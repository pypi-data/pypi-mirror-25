0.4.0   Initial release

0.4.1   Added support for python 3.4
        Does cause an error message when installing
        with 3.4. This error message does not affect 
        operation.
0.4.2
0.4.3  Mostly an apparent race condition on slower cpu

0.4.4  Thanks to Anders Melchiorsen
       close transport on lost connection
       use discovery_interval correctly
       make sure that the reply to last attempt at sending
       a command is handled correctly
       
0.4.5  Thanks to Anders Melchiorsen
       Bug in msgtypes.py Needed a binary string, not a string for Lifx Z
       Streamline fire_sending and try_sending so that the app does not
       have to check if the connection is still active.

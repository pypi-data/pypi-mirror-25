AioLifxC is a Python 3/asyncio library to control Lifx LED lightbulbs over your LAN.

Most of it was originally taken from the
`Meghan Clarkk lifxlan package <https://github.com/mclarkk/lifxlan>`_
and adapted to Python 3 (and asyncio obviously)

This is a fork from
`Fran√ßois Wautier's package <https://github.com/frawau/aiolifx>`_.
It uses coroutines as opposed to callbacks. If you prefer callbacks,
please see his implementation instead. This was forked from version 0.5.0.


Installation
------------

We are on PyPi so::

     pip3 install aiolifxc

or::

     python3 -m pip install aiolifxc

How to use
----------

In essence, the test program is this::

    def readin():
    """Reading from stdin and displaying menu"""

        selection = sys.stdin.readline().strip("\n")
        DoSomething()

    loop = aio.get_event_loop()
    devices = Devices(loop=loop)

    loop.add_reader(sys.stdin, readin)

    devices.start_discover()

    try:
        loop.run_forever()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Got exception %s" % e)
    finally:
        loop.remove_reader(sys.stdin)
        loop.close()

Other things worth noting:

    -  Whilst LifxDiscover uses UDP broadcast, the bulbs are
       connected with Unicast UDP

    - The socket connecting to a bulb is not closed unless the bulb is deemed to have
      gone the way of the Dodo. I've been using that for days with no problem

    - You can select to used IPv6 connection to the bulbs by passing an
      IPv6 prefix to LifxDiscover. It's only been tried with /64 prefix.
      If you want to use a /48 prefix, add ":" (colon) at the end of the 
      prefix and pray. (This means 2 colons at the end!)

    - I only have Original 1000, so I could not test with other types
      of bulbs

    - Unlike in lifxlan, set_waveform takes a dictionary with the right 
      keys instead of all those parameters

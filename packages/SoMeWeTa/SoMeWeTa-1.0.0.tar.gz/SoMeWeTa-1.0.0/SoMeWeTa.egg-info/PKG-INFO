        ========
        
        SoMeWeTa is a state-of-the-art part-of-speech tagger for German web
        and social media texts that follows the guidelines of the `EmpiriST
        2015 shared task <https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/>`_ on
        automatic linguistic annotation of computer-mediated communication /

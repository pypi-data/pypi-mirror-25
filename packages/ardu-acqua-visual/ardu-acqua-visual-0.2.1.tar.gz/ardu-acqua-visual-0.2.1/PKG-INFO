        =================
        
        Status
        ------
        
        This project will probably never leave the status of:
        Development - Alpha/Beta/Whatever
        
        As I started this project, I installed python-virtual from
        the debian apt repo (as I have both a debian-desktop and
        a raspbian-develbox).
        This is great for security, but not that great for
        feature coverage...
        
        Now I am starting to play around with IPython and Jupyter and
        use vpython installed through pip - but still, for the arduino
        project, I will probably use both tracks in parallel for some
        time..
        
        
        Dependencies, Requirements
        --------------------------
        
         * Debian/Raspian
        
          - python-visual
        
         * Python 2
        
          - tested against: 2.7
        
          - see requrements.txt for further dependencies
        
        
        Basic Idea
        ----------
        
        Just for fun..
        
        For the flussbad-berlin.de project we want to visualize the
        sensor values in a very basic and inexpensive way. So I just
        got a little 5" touchscreen for the raspberry pi, which is
        connected to the arduino, which is collecting sensor data.
        I then put
        the whole stuff into an old wooden wine box...
        
        This is just a first test to see whether the raspberry pi is
        not getting too busy..
        
        
        Outlook
        -------
        
        Really nice to have would be a vpython7 based collection
        of objects, that could be loaded based on a JSON config
        to visualize a certain sensor setup...

File formats
============

Pootle supports :ref:`many file formats <toolkit:formats>` through the powerful
*Translate Toolkit* API.  The Toolkit also provides several :ref:`format
converters <toolkit:commands#converters>` for other formats, this will allow
you to host a lot of translatable content on Pootle.

All these formats can be downloaded for offline use/or translation (for example
in Virtaal). We recommend *Virtaal* for offline translation. They can also be
downloaded in XLIFF format.

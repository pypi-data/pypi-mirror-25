Pootle Development Roadmap
==========================

We track the development roadmap using `Github Milestones
<https://github.com/translate/pootle/milestones>`_.  These match the version
numbers of future releases.

Project specific milestones are tracked using ``mstone-$name`` milestones.

.. note:: Development partners may use their own systems to track their
   roadmaps.

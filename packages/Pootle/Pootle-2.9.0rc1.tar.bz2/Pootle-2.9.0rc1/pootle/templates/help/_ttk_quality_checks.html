<h3 id="accelerators">Accelerators</h3>

<p>Checks whether accelerators are consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>This test is capable of checking the different type of accelerators
that are used in different projects, like Mozilla or KDE. The test will
pick up accelerators that are missing and ones that shouldn't be there.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/localization-guide/en/latest/guide/translation/accelerators.html">accelerators on the localization guide</a>
for a full description on accelerators.</p>


<h3 id="acronyms">Acronyms</h3>

<p>Checks that acronyms that appear are unchanged.</p>
<p>If an acronym appears in the original this test will check that it
appears in the translation. Translating acronyms is a language decision
but many languages leave them unchanged. In that case this test is
useful for tracking down translations of the acronym and correcting
them.</p>


<h3 id="blank">Blank</h3>

<p>Checks whether a translation is totally blank.</p>
<p>This will check to see if a translation has inadvertently been
translated as blank i.e. as spaces. This is different from untranslated
which is completely empty. This test is useful in that if something is
translated as &quot;  &quot; it will appear to most tools as if it is translated.</p>


<h3 id="brackets">Brackets</h3>

<p>Checks that the number of brackets in both strings match.</p>
<p>If <tt class="docutils literal">([{</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">}])</tt> appear in the original this will check that the
same number appear in the translation.</p>


<h3 id="cedillas">Romanian: Avoid cedilla diacritics</h3>

<p>Check if the translation contains an illegal cedilla character</p>
<p>Cedillas are obsoleted diacritics for Romanian:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>U+0162 Latin capital letter T with cedilla</li>
<li>U+0163 Latin small letter T with cedilla</li>
<li>U+015E Latin capital letter S with cedilla</li>
<li>U+015F Latin small letter S with cedilla</li>
</ul>
<p>Cedilla-letters are only valid for Turkish (S-cedilla) and Gagauz
languages (S-cedilla and T-comma). Fun fact: Gagauz is the only known
language to use T-cedilla.</p>
<table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">

<tr class="field"><th class="field-name">return:</th><td class="field-body">True if str2 contains a cedilla character</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<h3 id="compendiumconflicts">Compendium conflict</h3>

<p>Checks for Gettext compendium conflicts (#-#-#-#-#).</p>
<p>When you use msgcat to create a PO compendium it will insert
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#-#-#-#-#</span></tt> into entries that are not consistent. If the compendium
is used later in a message merge then these conflicts will appear in
your translations. This test quickly extracts those for correction.</p>


<h3 id="credits">Translator credits</h3>

<p>Checks for messages containing translation credits instead of
normal translations.</p>
<p>Some projects have consistent ways of giving credit to translators by
having a unit or two where translators can fill in their name and
possibly their contact details. This test allows you to find these
units easily to check that they are completed correctly and also
disables other tests that might incorrectly get triggered for these
units (such as urls, emails, etc.)</p>


<h3 id="doublequoting">Double quotes</h3>

<p>Checks whether doublequoting is consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>Checks on double quotes <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;</tt> to ensure that you have the same number
in both the original and the translated string. This tests takes into
account that several languages use different quoting characters, and
will test for them instead.</p>


<h3 id="doublespacing">Double spaces</h3>

<p>Checks for bad double-spaces by comparing to original.</p>
<p>This will identify if you have [space][space] in when you don't have it
in the original or it appears in the original but not in your
translation. Some of these are spurious and how you correct them
depends on the conventions of your language.</p>


<h3 id="doublewords">Repeated word</h3>

<p>Checks for repeated words in the translation.</p>
<p>Words that have been repeated in a translation will be highlighted with
this test e.g. &quot;the the&quot;, &quot;a a&quot;. These are generally typos that need
correcting. Some languages may have valid repeated words in their
structure, in that case either ignore those instances or switch this
test off.</p>


<h3 id="emails">E-mail</h3>

<p>Checks that emails are not translated.</p>
<p>Generally you should not be translating email addresses. This check
will look to see that email addresses e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">info&#64;example.com</tt> are not
translated. In some cases of course you should translate the address
but generally you shouldn't.</p>


<h3 id="endpunc">Ending punctuation</h3>

<p>Checks whether punctuation at the end of the strings match.</p>
<p>This will ensure that the ending of your translation has the same
punctuation as the original. E.g. if it ends in :[space] then so should
yours. It is useful for ensuring that you have ellipses [...] in all
your translations, not simply three separate full-stops. You may pick
up some errors in the original: feel free to keep your translation and
notify the programmers. In some languages, characters such as <tt class="docutils literal">?</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">!</tt> are always preceded by a space e.g. [space]? â€” do what your
language customs dictate. Other false positives you will notice are,
for example, if through changes in word-order you add &quot;), etc. at the
end of the sentence. Do not change these: your language word-order
takes precedence.</p>
<p>It must be noted that if you are tempted to leave out [full-stop] or
[colon] or add [full-stop] to a sentence, that often these have been
done for a reason, e.g. a list where fullstops make it look cluttered.
So, initially match them with the English, and make changes once the
program is being used.</p>
<p>This check is aware of several language conventions for punctuation
characters, such as the custom question marks for Greek and Arabic,
Devanagari Danda, full-width punctuation for CJK languages, etc.
Support for your language can be added easily if it is not there yet.</p>


<h3 id="endwhitespace">Ending whitespace</h3>

<p>Checks whether whitespace at the end of the strings matches.</p>
<p>Operates the same as endpunc but is only concerned with whitespace.
This filter is particularly useful for those strings which will
evidently be followed by another string in the program, e.g.
[Password: ] or [Enter your username: ]. The whitespace is an inherent
part of the string. This filter makes sure you don't miss those
important but otherwise invisible spaces!</p>
<p>If your language uses full-width punctuation (like Chinese), the visual
spacing in the character might be enough without an added extra space.</p>


<h3 id="escapes">Escapes</h3>

<p>Checks whether escaping is consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>Checks escapes such as <tt class="docutils literal">\n</tt> <tt class="docutils literal">\u0000</tt> to ensure that if they exist
in the original string you also have them in the translation.</p>


<h3 id="filepaths">File paths</h3>

<p>Checks that file paths have not been translated.</p>
<p>Checks that paths such as <tt class="docutils literal">/home/user1</tt> have not been translated.
Generally you do not translate a file path, unless it is being used as
an example, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">your_user_name/path/to/filename.conf</tt>.</p>


<h3 id="functions">Functions</h3>

<p>Checks that function names are not translated.</p>
<p>Checks that function names e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">rgb()</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">getEntity.Name()</tt> are
not translated.</p>


<h3 id="kdecomments">Old KDE comment</h3>

<p>Checks to ensure that no KDE style comments appear in the
translation.</p>
<p>KDE style translator comments appear in PO files as
<tt class="docutils literal">&quot;_: comment\n&quot;</tt>. New translators often translate the comment. This
test tries to identify instances where the comment has been translated.</p>


<h3 id="long">Long</h3>

<p>Checks whether a translation is much longer than the original
string.</p>
<p>This is most useful in the special case where the translation is
multiple characters long while the source text is only 1 character
long. Otherwise, we use a general ratio that will catch very big
differences but is set conservatively to limit the number of false
positives.</p>


<h3 id="musttranslatewords">Must translate words</h3>

<p>Checks that words configured as definitely translatable don't appear
in the translation.</p>
<p>If for instance in your language you decide that you must translate
'OK' then this test will flag any occurrences of 'OK' in the
translation if it appeared in the source string. You must specify a
file containing all of the <em>must translate</em> words using
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--musttranslatefile</span></tt>.</p>


<h3 id="newlines">Newlines</h3>

<p>Checks whether newlines are consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>Counts the number of <tt class="docutils literal">\n</tt> newlines (and variants such as <tt class="docutils literal">\r\n</tt>)
and reports and error if they differ.</p>


<h3 id="niciun_nicio">Romanian: Use "niciun"/"nicio"</h3>

<p>Checks for sequences containing 'nici un'/'nici o' which are obsolete
Romanian syntax. Correct is 'niciun'/'nicio'</p>


<h3 id="notranslatewords">Don't translate words</h3>

<p>Checks that words configured as untranslatable appear in the
translation too.</p>
<p>Many brand names should not be translated, this test allows you to
easily make sure that words like: Word, Excel, Impress, Calc, etc. are
not translated. You must specify a file containing all of the
<em>no translate</em> words using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--notranslatefile</span></tt>.</p>


<h3 id="nplurals">Number of plurals</h3>

<p>Checks for the correct number of noun forms for plural translations.</p>
<p>This uses the plural information in the language module of the
Translate Toolkit. This is the same as the Gettext nplural value. It
will check that the number of plurals required is the same as the
number supplied in your translation.</p>


<h3 id="numbers">Numbers</h3>

<p>Checks whether numbers of various forms are consistent between the
two strings.</p>
<p>You will see some errors where you have either written the number in
full or converted it to the digit in your translation. Also changes in
order will trigger this error.</p>


<h3 id="options">Options</h3>

<p>Checks that command line options are not translated.</p>
<p>In messages that contain command line options, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--help</span></tt>,
this test will check that these remain untranslated. These could be
translated in the future if programs can create a mechanism to allow
this, but currently they are not translated. If the options has a
parameter, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--file=FILE</span></tt>, then the test will check that the
parameter has been translated.</p>


<h3 id="printf">printf()</h3>

<p>Checks whether printf format strings match.</p>
<p>If the printf formatting variables are not identical, then this will
indicate an error. Printf statements are used by programs to format
output in a human readable form (they are placeholders for variable
data). They allow you to specify lengths of string variables, string
padding, number padding, precision, etc. Generally they will look like
this: <tt class="docutils literal">%d</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">%5.2f</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">%100s</tt>, etc. The test can also manage
variables-reordering using the <tt class="docutils literal">%1$s</tt> syntax. The variables' type and
details following data are tested to ensure that they are strictly
identical, but they may be reordered.</p>
<p>See also <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string">printf Format String</a>.</p>


<h3 id="puncspacing">Punctuation spacing</h3>

<p>Checks for bad spacing after punctuation.</p>
<p>In the case of [full-stop][space] in the original, this test checks
that your translation does not remove the space. It checks also for
[comma], [colon], etc.</p>
<p>Some languages don't use spaces after common punctuation marks,
especially where full-width punctuation marks are used. This check will
take that into account.</p>


<h3 id="purepunc">Pure punctuation</h3>

<p>Checks that strings that are purely punctuation are not changed.</p>
<p>This extracts strings like <tt class="docutils literal">+</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">-</tt> as these usually should not
be changed.</p>


<h3 id="pythonbraceformat">Python brace placeholders</h3>

<p>Checks whether python brace format strings match.</p>


<h3 id="sentencecount">Number of sentences</h3>

<p>Checks that the number of sentences in both strings match.</p>
<p>Adds the number of sentences to see that the sentence count is the same
between the original and translated string. You may not always want to
use this test, if you find you often need to reformat your translation,
because the original is badly-expressed, or because the structure of
your language works better that way. Do what works best for your
language: it's the meaning of the original you want to convey, not the
exact way it was written in the English.</p>


<h3 id="short">Short</h3>

<p>Checks whether a translation is much shorter than the original
string.</p>
<p>This is most useful in the special case where the translation is 1
characters long while the source text is multiple characters long.
Otherwise, we use a general ratio that will catch very big differences
but is set conservatively to limit the number of false positives.</p>


<h3 id="simplecaps">Simple capitalization</h3>

<p>Checks the capitalisation of two strings isn't wildly different.</p>
<p>This will pick up many false positives, so don't be a slave to it. It
is useful for identifying translations that don't start with a capital
letter (upper-case letter) when they should, or those that do when they
shouldn't. It will also highlight sentences that have extra capitals;
depending on the capitalisation convention of your language, you might
want to change these to Title Case, or change them all to normal
sentence case.</p>


<h3 id="simpleplurals">Simple plural(s)</h3>

<p>Checks for English style plural(s) for you to review.</p>
<p>This test will extract any message that contains words with a final
&quot;(s)&quot; in the source text. You can then inspect the message, to check
that the correct plural form has been used for your language. In some
languages, plurals are made by adding text at the beginning of words,
making the English style messy. In this case, they often revert to the
plural form. This test allows an editor to check that the plurals used
are correct. Be aware that this test may create a number of false
positives.</p>
<p>For languages with no plural forms (only one noun form) this test will
simply test that nothing like &quot;(s)&quot; was used in the translation.</p>


<h3 id="singlequoting">Single quotes</h3>

<p>Checks whether singlequoting is consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>The same as doublequoting but checks for the <tt class="docutils literal">'</tt> character. Because
this is used in contractions like it's and in possessive forms like
user's, this test can output spurious errors if your language doesn't
use such forms. If a quote appears at the end of a sentence in the
translation, i.e. <tt class="docutils literal">'.</tt>, this might not be detected properly by the
check.</p>


<h3 id="startcaps">Starting capitalization</h3>

<p>Checks that the message starts with the correct capitalisation.</p>
<p>After stripping whitespace and common punctuation characters, it then
checks to see that the first remaining character is correctly
capitalised. So, if the sentence starts with an upper-case letter, and
the translation does not, an error is produced.</p>
<p>This check is entirely disabled for many languages that don't make a
distinction between upper and lower case. Contact us if this is not yet
disabled for your language.</p>


<h3 id="startpunc">Starting punctuation</h3>

<p>Checks whether punctuation at the beginning of the strings match.</p>
<p>Operates as endpunc but you will probably see fewer errors.</p>


<h3 id="startwhitespace">Starting whitespace</h3>

<p>Checks whether whitespace at the beginning of the strings matches.</p>
<p>As in endwhitespace but you will see fewer errors.</p>


<h3 id="tabs">Tabs</h3>

<p>Checks whether tabs are consistent between the two strings.</p>
<p>Counts the number of <tt class="docutils literal">\t</tt> tab markers and reports an error if they
differ.</p>


<h3 id="unchanged">Unchanged</h3>

<p>Checks whether a translation is basically identical to the original
string.</p>
<p>This checks to see if the translation isnâ€™t just a copy of the English
original. Sometimes, this is what you want, but other times you will
detect words that should have been translated.</p>


<h3 id="urls">URLs</h3>

<p>Checks that URLs are not translated.</p>
<p>This checks only basic URLs (http, ftp, mailto etc.) not all URIs (e.g.
afp, smb, file). Generally, you don't want to translate URLs, unless
they are example URLs (<a class="reference external" href="http://your_server.com/filename.html">http://your_server.com/filename.html</a>). If the
URL is for configuration information, then you need to query the
developers about placing configuration information in PO files. It
shouldn't really be there, unless it is very clearly marked: such
information should go into a configuration file.</p>


<h3 id="validchars">Valid characters</h3>

<p>Checks that only characters specified as valid appear in the
translation.</p>
<p>Often during character conversion to and from UTF-8 you get some
strange characters appearing in your translation. This test presents a
simple way to try and identify such errors.</p>
<p>This test will only run of you specify the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--validcharsfile</span></tt> command
line option. This file contains all the characters that are valid in
your language. You must use UTF-8 encoding for the characters in the
file.</p>
<p>If the test finds any characters not in your valid characters file then
the test will print the character together with its Unicode value
(e.g. 002B).</p>


<h3 id="variables">Placeholders</h3>

<p>Checks whether variables of various forms are consistent between the
two strings.</p>
<p>This checks to make sure that variables that appear in the original
also appear in the translation. It can handle variables from projects
like KDE or OpenOffice. It does not at the moment cope with variables
that use the reordering syntax of Gettext PO files.</p>


<h3 id="xmltags">XML tags</h3>

<p>Checks that XML/HTML tags have not been translated.</p>
<p>This check finds the number of tags in the source string and checks
that the same number are in the translation. If the counts don't match
then either the tag is missing or it was mistakenly translated by the
translator, both of which are errors.</p>
<p>The check ignores tags or things that look like tags that cover the
whole string e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;Error&gt;</tt> but will produce false positives for
things like <tt class="docutils literal">An &lt;Error&gt; occurred</tt> as here <tt class="docutils literal">Error</tt> should be
translated. It also will allow translation of the <em>alt</em> attribute in
e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;img <span class="pre">src=&quot;bob.png&quot;</span> <span class="pre">alt=&quot;Image</span> description&quot;&gt;</tt> or similar
translatable attributes in OpenOffice.org help files.</p>

Welcome to the Pootle 2.6.0 Interim

Direct upgrade is now only possible from 2.5.0 and later.

We have dropped some legacy upgrade features. The removal of some of these
feature means that upgrading directly from ancient Pootle versions is no longer
possible.

  2.1.6 before upgrading to this version.

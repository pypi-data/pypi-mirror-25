Pootle is a full featured online tool with several possible methods for
installation. This file gives a few brief instructions to get started, but more
complete documentation exists online at:

  http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/pootle/en/latest/server/installation.html

Pootle depends on a few Python packages, and can optionally use several others
for an optimal feature set and performance. Although a minimal installation
might be enough for initial experimentation, this won't provide the best
security, features or performance.


Security note
-------------
The simple method shown in the link above for running Pootle does not use a
dedicated web server thus it is not considered safe, flexible or to have a good
performance for production purposes. For further information:

Performance note
----------------
The simple method shown in the link above for running Pootle does not configure
it for optimal performance. More information:

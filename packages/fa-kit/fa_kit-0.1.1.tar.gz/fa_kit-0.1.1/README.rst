# fa_kit
Factor Analysis Kit version 0.1.1

I've re-written various factor analysis tools for my own use several times over the years, so I'm trying to come up with a single factor analysis package that does everything I want.

This should be compatible with Python 2 and 3.

`./fa_test` has the main package
`./examples` has Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the package
`./tests` contains pytest unit tests

# Installation
You can install it using pip like this: `pip install fa_kit`

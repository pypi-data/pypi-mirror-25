Merge multiple GenBank records using a defined spacer sequence
==============================================================

| A small script to turn a multiple GenBank records (either in multiple
  files or a
| single multi-record file) into a single record.

| Sequences are merged by concatenating them in order, and putting a
  spacer
| sequence between them. Spacer sequence length can be given in kbp. It
  is
| possible to pick an all-N spacer, or using a spacer consisting of
  all-frame stop
| codons.

Installation
------------

::

    pip install merge-gbk-records

Alternatively, clone this repository from GitHub, then run (in a python
virtual environment)

::

    pip install .

If this fails on older versions of Python, try updating your ``pip``
tool first:

::

    pip install --upgrade pip

and then rerun the ``merge-gbk-records`` install.

| ``merge-gbk-records`` is only developed and tested on Python releases
  still under active
| support by the Python project. At the moment, this means versions 2.7,
  3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6.
| Specifically, no attempt at testing under Python versions older than
  2.7 or 3.3 is being made.

| If your system is stuck on an older version of Python, consider using
  a tool like
| `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`__ or `Linuxbrew <http://linuxbrew.sh>`__
  to obtain a more up-to-date
| version.

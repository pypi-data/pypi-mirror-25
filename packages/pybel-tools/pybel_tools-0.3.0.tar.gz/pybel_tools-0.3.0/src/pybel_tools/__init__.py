Caveats
-------
PyBEL Tools contains many dependencies, including the scientific Python Stack (numpy, scipy, etc.). This makes 
installation difficult for Windows users, for whom Python cannot easily build C extensions. We recommend using an 
`Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ distribution of Python, which includes these precompiled.

Adding New Web Services
-----------------------
These documents are for developers who want to extend PyBEL Web.

Admin Only

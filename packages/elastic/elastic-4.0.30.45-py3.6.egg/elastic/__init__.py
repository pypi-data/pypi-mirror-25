Elastic Module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module depends on :ref:`par-calc-mod` for parallelisation of
independent calculations.

Elastic is a module for calculation of :math:`C_{ij}` components of elastic
tensor from the strain-stress relation.

The strain components here are ordered in standard way which is different
to ordering in previous versions of the code.

The ordering is: :math:`u_{xx}, u_{yy}, u_{zz}, u_{yz}, u_{xz}, u_{xy}`.

The general ordering of :math:`C_{ij}` components is (except for triclinic symmetry and taking into account customary names of constants - e.g.
:math:`C_{16} \\rightarrow C_{14}`):

.. math::
   C_{11}, C_{22}, C_{33}, C_{12}, C_{13}, C_{23},
   C_{44}, C_{55}, C_{66}, C_{16}, C_{26}, C_{36}, C_{45}

The functions outside of the Crystal class define the symmetry of the
:math:`C_{ij}` matrix. The matrix is N columns by 6 rows where the columns
corespond to independent elastic constants of the given crystal, while the rows
corespond to the canonical deformations of a crystal. The elements are the
second partial derivatives of the free energy formula for the crystal written
down as a quadratic form of the deformations with respect to elastic constant
and deformation.

*Note:*
The elements for deformations :math:`u_{xy}, u_{xz}, u_{yz}`
have to be divided by 2 to properly match the usual definition
of elastic constants.

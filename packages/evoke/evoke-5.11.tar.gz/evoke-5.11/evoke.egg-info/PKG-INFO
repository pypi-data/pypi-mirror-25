Description: # evoke 5
        
        This is the python 3 version of EVOKE, currently in _active_ development.
        
        EVOKE is a simple and powerful python web framework with pythonic "evo" templating.
        
        The evoke module allows you to create twisted evoke apps (server applications) which:
        
        - use mysql for data storage, and present the data to you as python objects
        - produce HTML output via evoke's own "evo" templating
        - use twisted webserver (optionally proxied via apache) to serve the data
        
        
        ## requirements
        
        - python3 (tested on 3.6.2)
        - linux (should work on BSD and MacOS also - but no yet tested)
        - mysql
        
        ## installation
        
            pip3 install evoke
        
        ## usage
        
        Evoke is a longstanding and stable system, that has been in use for commercial
        mission-critical systems since its inception in 2001.
        
        However, python packaging and automated install are a recent work in progress.
        
        For now: manually configure evoke and create your evoke app(s):
        
        ## manual install
        
        - pip will have installed the "evoke" module at eg: `usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages` (or `usr/local/lib..` etc.)
        
          - create an `evoke/config_site.py` file, similar to `evoke/config_site.example`, but with your mysql connect parameters
        
          - create an app with a name of your choice (say `yourapp`) using the `evoke/create_app` script:
        
            ./create_app yourapp
        
          - create a `yourapp/config_site.py` file, similar to `yourapp/config_site.example`:
            - specify the `port` if you don't wnat the default of `8080`
            - specify the `domains` if you don't want default of `127.0.0.1`
        
        - pip will have installed the `site` folder at eg: `usr/site` (or `usr/local/site` )
        
          - create a subfolder there named `yourapp` (or whatever app name you are using)
        
          - symlink `yourapp/site` to that subfolder `site/yourapp`
        
        
        ### start the app:
        
            cd yourapp
            ./start
        
        ### stop the app
        
            yourapp/stop
        
        ### restart the app:
        
            cd yourapp
            ./restart
        
        
        When you first start an app, the mysql database for that app will be created.
        
        The app will be visible at the domain and port specified, eg (using the defaults):
        
            http://127.0.0.1:8080/

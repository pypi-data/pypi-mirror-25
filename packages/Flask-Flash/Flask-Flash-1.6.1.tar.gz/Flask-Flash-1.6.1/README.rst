Flask Simple API
================

Flask API Framework to create CRUD APIs (and non-CRUD) with embedded API client.

| To create a new API, you need to create the following files: app/\ **init**.py app/manage.py
| app/models.py app/resources.py

Take a look at the example apps in the examples/ folder. You can run the example apps like:

::

    cd examples/<example>
    ./manage.py runserver

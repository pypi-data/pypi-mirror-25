        This product, ``eke.site``, provides display and RDF ingest of participating
        sites that have joined the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN_).  Sites,
        staff members, and investigators are integral parts of the EDRN Knowledge
        Environment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to make it easy to discover, share,
        search for, and retrieve all of EDRN's collective knowledge, including cancers
        and other diseases, biomarkers, specimens, participants, studies, protocols,
        and-as in the case of this product-sites and staff.
        
        Although intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any
        Plone_ compatible site.
        
        This software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,
        operated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Use Buildout_ with the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe.
        
        • Add ``eke.site`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
         
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                eke.site
                
        • Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
          
            % ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

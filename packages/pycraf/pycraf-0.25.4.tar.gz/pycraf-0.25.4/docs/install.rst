Requirements
============

pycraf has the following strict requirements:

- `Python <http://www.python.org/>`__ 3.5 or later

- `setuptools <https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/>`__: Used for the package
  installation.

- `Cython <http://cython.org/>`__ 0.23 or later

- `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`__ 1.11 or later

- `SciPy <https://scipy.org/>`__: 0.15 or later

- `astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`__: 1.3 or later (2.0 recommended)

- `pytest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest>`__ 2.6 or later


There are a few optional packages, which are necessary for some functionality:

- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`__ 1.5 or later: To provide plotting
  functionality that `~pycraf.pathprof.helper` enhances.

- `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ 1.9 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.geospatial` package.

- `sgp4 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sgp4>`__ 1.4 or later: This is a
  requirement for the `~pycraf.satellite` package.


Installing pycraf
==================

Using pip
-------------

To install pycraf with `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/>`__, simply run

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pycraf

.. note::

    You may need a C compiler (``gcc``) to be installed for the installation
    to succeed. Since `pycraf` needs OpenMP, ``clang`` is currently not
    supported.

.. note::

    Use the ``--no-deps`` flag if you already have dependency packages
    installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your installation, which may not always be desired.

.. note::

    If you get a ``PermissionError`` this means that you do not have the
    required administrative access to install new packages to your Python
    installation.  In this case you may consider using the ``--user`` option
    to install the package into your home directory.  You can read more
    about how to do this in the `pip documentation
    <http://www.pip-installer.org/en/1.2.1/other-tools.html#using-pip-with-the-user-scheme>`__.

    We recommend to use a Python distribution, such as `Anaconda
    <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, especially, if you are on
    :ref:`windows_install`.

    Do **not** install pycraf or other third-party packages using ``sudo``
    unless you are fully aware of the risks.

.. _source_install:

Installation from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two options, if you want to build pycraf from sources. Either, you
install the tar-ball (`*.tar.gz` file) from `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycraf>`_ and extract it to the directory of
your choice, or, if you always want to stay up-to-date, clone the git
repository:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf

Then go into the pycraf source directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py install

Again, consider the ``--user`` option or even better use a python distribution
such as `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ to avoid messing up
the system-wide Python installation.


.. _windows_install:

Installation on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that for Windows machines we provide a binary wheel (Python 3.5+ only).
However, the `pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`_ package is a
dependency and unfortunately, the official
`pyproj <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyproj>`__ repository on PyPI contains
only the sources. You can download a
suitable wheel from `Christoph Gohlke's package site
<http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyproj>`__. Then use

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install [path-to-wheel]/pyprojâ€‘*.whl

If you're using `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`__
(recommended), it gets much simpler

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install -c conda-forge pyproj
    pip install pycraf

.. note::

    If you are desperate, you can install pycraf from source even on Windows.
    You'll need to install a suitable C-compiler; <see here
    <https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/python_msvc.html#visual-studio-versions-used-to-compile-distributed-python-binaries>`__. The pycraf
    package needs Python 3.5 or later, which means VC++ Version 14 is
    mandatory. The easiest way to obtain it, is by installing the
    `Visual C++ 2015 Build Tools
    <http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools>`__ which is
    "only" 4 GBytes large...


.. _macos_install:

Installation on MacOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even though we also provide a binary wheel for MacOS, it seems you'll still
have to install a C-compiler, in particular *gcc-6*. The clang compiler
seems not to support OpenMP in a way that is needed by pycraf:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install gcc6
    brew link --overwrite gcc@6

Then proceed as usual with

.. code-block:: bash

    # if on Anaconda, install pyproj the easy way:
    conda install -c conda-forge pyproj

    # then
    pip install pycraf

.. warning::

    Currently, we only provide MacOS wheels for *gcc-6* (version 6.4).
    It seems that if you have a different version of *gcc-6* on your machine
    importing pycraf will fail with some ``libgomp`` error, which is probably
    due to binary inconsistencies between the various *gcc* versions.
    Please, consider updating to the 6.4-version of *gcc*, or install from
    source with your own *gcc* compiler.

.. _testing_installed_pycraf:

Testing an installed pycraf
----------------------------

The easiest way to test your installed version of pycraf is running
correctly is to use the `~pycraf.test()` function::

    import pycraf
    pycraf.test()

To run the tests for one sub-package, e.g., `conversions`, only::

    import pycraf
    pycraf.test('conversions')

The tests should run and print out any failures, which you can report at
the `pycraf issue tracker <http://github.com/bwinkel/pycraf/issues>`__.

.. note::

    This way of running the tests may not work if you do it in the
    pycraf source distribution directory.

.. note::

    By default, the `test` function will skip over tests that require
    data from the internet. One can include them by::

        import pycraf
        pycraf.test(remote_data='any')

    This will *always* download SRTM data (few tiles only) to test the
    auto-download functionality! Do this only, if you can afford the
    network traffic.

If you prefer testing on the command line and usually work with the source
code, you can also do

.. code-block:: bash

    python setup.py test

    # to run tests from a sub-package
    python setup.py test -P conversions

    # include tests, which need to download data (will slow down tests)
    python setup.py test --remote-data=any

.. _srtm_data:

Using SRTM data
---------------

To make full use of the path attenuation calculations provided by pycraf,
you will need to use NASA's Shuttle Radar Topography Mission
`(SRTM) data <https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/>`__ for height-profile
generation. Please see :ref:`working_with_srtm` for further details.

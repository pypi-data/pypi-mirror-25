Launching pad
-------------

* If you don't know what Particle Swarm Optimization is, read up this short `Introduction <http://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html>`_! Then, if you plan to use PySwarms in your project, check the `Installation guide <https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`_ and the `use-case examples <https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/usecases.html>`_ in this documentation.

* If you are a researcher in the field of swarm intelligence, and would like to include your technique in our list of optimizers, check our `contributing <https://pyswarms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_ page to see how to implement your optimizer using the current base classes in the library.

* If you are an open-source contributor, and would like to help PySwarms grow, be sure to check our `Issues <https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms/issues>`_ page in Github, and see the open issues with the tag `help-wanted <https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms/labels/help%20wanted>`_. Moreover, we accommodate contributions from first-time contributors! Just check our `first-timers-only <https://github.com/ljvmiranda921/pyswarms/labels/first-timers-only>`_ tag for open issues (Don't worry! We're happy to help you make your first PR!).

Description: A small logger that lets you write logs readable by Tensorboard but
        doesnâ€™t require Tensorflow.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Use the logger as a context manager:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from tensorboard_easy import Logger
        
            with Logger('/path/to/logs/folder/') as log:
                log.log_scalar('my_tag', 100, step=1)
        
        It supports scalars, images, text and histograms.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        It can be installed via pip:
        
        ``pip install tensorboard-easy``
        
        The ``tensorflow`` or ``tensorflow-tensorboard`` packages are not
        required, however you will need one of them to visualize your logs.

ITKIsotropicWavelets provides a multiresolution analysis(MRA) framework using isotropic and steerable wavelets in the frequencydomain.
This framework provides the backbone for state of the art filtersfor denoising, feature detection or phase analysis in N-dimensions.It focus on reusability, and highly decoupled modules for easy extensionand implementation of new filters.

'''
This Python package (elfcommander) creates a class named ElfCommander to
communcate with and control the Janelia Elf. The Elf
uses two hardware control devices, the mixed_signal_controller
modular_client, and the bioshake_device. The
mixed_signal_controller both switches the valves and reads the
analog signals from the cylinder hall effect sensors. The
bioshake_device controls the heater/shaker.
Example Usage:

elf = ElfCommander('example_calibration.yaml','example_config.yaml')
elf.run_protocol()

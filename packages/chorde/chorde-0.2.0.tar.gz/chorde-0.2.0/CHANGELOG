# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.

## [0.2.0] - 2017-09-20
### Changed
- Made ttl_skip not return default/CacheMissError when the
  only available value is below the skip threshold. Instead,
  return the available item as does TieredInclusiveCache.
  The logic works better with lazy decorators and async
  refresh in this way, and is more uniform across clients.
- FastMemcachedClient: Refresh DNS in the bgwriter thread
  to avoid latency spikes caused by DNS queries

### Added
- Support for getMulti and getTtlMulti to all clients,
  with optimized versions for memcached
- An option tcp_nodelay to MemcachedStoreClient to reduce
  latency in latency-sensitive applications
- Add a LazyCuckooCache implementing a lazy form of
  cuckoo hashing (ie: without relocation) to implement a
  quasi-LRU eviction strategy with O(1) reads and updates

## [0.1.0]

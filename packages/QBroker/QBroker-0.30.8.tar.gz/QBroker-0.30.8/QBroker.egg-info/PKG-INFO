Description: QBroker is short for Quick Access Broker.
        
        QBroker is Python library which provides an easy-to-use interface for asynchronous, debuggable RPC via AMQP.
        It uses Python 3.4 asyncio features and provides wrappers for use with native threads or gevent tasklets.
        
        Example scripts, including an event/RPC monitor, are provided.
        
        The QBroker data format is straightforward. Writing an adapter in a different programming language
        is straightforward, given JSON and AMQP libraries. You can add codecs for your classes, or replace
        JSON with another marshalling system.
        
        QBroker supports the time-to-live and dead-lettering extensions of RabbitMQ, but does not depend on them.
        Its support for monitoring does not rely on RabbitM's "firehose" tracing feature.
        
        QBroker supports (as-yet rudimentary) introspection.

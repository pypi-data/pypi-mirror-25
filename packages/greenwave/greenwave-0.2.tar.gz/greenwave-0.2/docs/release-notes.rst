Greenwave 0.2
=============

Released 27 Sep 2017.

A number of issues have been resolved in this release:

* `Issue 34`_: Expanded :http:post:`/api/v1.0/decision` to accept a list of dicts
  as the subject of a decision.
* `Issue 35`_: For safety, the policies are loaded with yaml.safe_load_all.
* `Issue 36`_: Corrected the API docs examples.
* `Issue 60`_: Added type checks when loading the policies.
* `Issue 65`_: Added JSONP support.
* `Issue 72`_: Added a new HTTP API endpoint :http:get:`/api/v1.0/policies` exposing
  raw policies.
* `Issue 77`_: Employed an actively-invalidated cache mechanism to cache resultsdb
  and waiverdb results in order to improve gating performance.
* `Issue 78`_: Removed the init methods on our YAMLObject classes which are not
  called at all.
* `Issue 83`_: Greenwave now sends POST requests for getting waivers to avoid
  HTTP Error 413.
* `Issue 87`_: Greenwave now publishes messages when decision contexts change.

Other updates
-------------

* New HTTP API endpoint :http:get:`/api/v1.0/version`.
* Two new parameters ``ignore_result`` and ``ignore_waiver`` for
  :http:post:`/api/v1.0/decision` so that a list of results and waivers can be
  ignored when making the decision.

Also numerous improvements have made to the test and docs for Greenwave.

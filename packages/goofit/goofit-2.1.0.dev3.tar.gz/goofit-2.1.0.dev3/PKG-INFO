Description: GooFit for Python
        -----------------
        
        GooFit is a highly parallel fitting framework originally designed for High Energy Physics.
        
        Installation: pipenv
        ====================
        
        Best method for an install you don't expect to change!
        Use pipenv, the officially recommended method for managing installs, virtual environments, and dependencies.
        
        To install::
        
            pipenv install goofit
        
        To run a shell::
        
            pipenv shell
        
        
        Installation: pip
        =================
        
        This package can be installed with pip, but uses SciKit-Build, and is build, fully optimized, on your system. Because of this, there are a few caveats when running a pip install. Make sure you have SciKit-Build (``pip install scikit-build``) before you attempt an install. Also, if you don't have a recent version of CMake (3.8 or better recommended), also run ``pip install cmake``. When you build, you should also use pip's ``-v`` flag, so that you can see it build (and observe the
        configuration options). Otherwise, you might wait a very long time without output (especially if CUDA was found).
        
        In practice, this looks like this::
        
            pip install scikit-build cmake
            pip install -v goofit
        
        
        Installation: local
        ===================
        
        If you want to add PDFs to GooFit, or use GooFit pacakges, you should be working in a local directory using git. In the following example, I'm assuming you've set up SSH keys with GitHub; you can use https instead if you perfer by changing the URL to ``https://github.com/GooFit/GooFit.git``::
        
            git clone --recursive git@github.com:GooFit/GooFit.git
            cd goofit
            pipenv install --verbose -e .
        
        And, to use::
        
            pipenv shell
        
        You can set the ``PIP_INSTALL_OPTIONS`` variable to pass through build command, for example::
        
            PIP_INSTALL_OPTIONS="-- -DGOOFIT_PACKAGES=OFF" pipenv install --verbose -e .
        
        You can also install development requirements with the ``--dev`` flag.
        
        Building a source package from git
        ==================================
        
        For developers only:
        
        To make a source package, start with a clean (such as new) git GooFit package with all submodules checked out::
        
            git clone --branch=master --recursive --depth=10 git@github.com:GooFit/GooFit.git
            cd goofit
            python setup.py sdist
            twine upload dist/*

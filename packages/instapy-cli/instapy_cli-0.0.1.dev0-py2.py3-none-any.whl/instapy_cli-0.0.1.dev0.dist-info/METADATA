## Introduction
There are a plenty of libraries written in Python dedicated to Instagram APIs (public or ***private***, no matter).. but most of them have unsolved issues and PR not maintained for a time as long as 5-6 months.

At the same time lots of developers want a simple and effective way to post/**upload** an photo/**image** **programmatically**.

So I dedice to start this repo and OpenSource it w/ :heart:


***`[FUTURE] spoiler:`*** And if I want to upload a video?

##### But, wait! Instagram don't let to upload a photo except from app ( of course :trollface: )
Short answer:
> Yes, you are right.

Long answer:
> Every connection from a mobile phone could be intercepted. Someone has done the hard work to sniff the packets sended from phone to Instagram and "spread the news". You could do a quick research.

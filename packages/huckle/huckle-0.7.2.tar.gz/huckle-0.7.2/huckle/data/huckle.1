.SH NAME
huckle \- A generic hypertext command line interface (HCLI) client
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B huckle
[
.I option

.I <command>
.I <parameter>
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B huckle
is a generic CLI that can be used with any API that abides by
the standard version 1.0 hypertext command line interface (HCLI) semantics.

A terminal restart is required after the creation of the very first CLI alias. CLI aliases created thereafter are immediately usable.

.SH COMMANDS
.IP "pull <url>"
This attempts to auto configure a CLI if provided with the root URL of an HCLI API. If successful, the CLI
can be invoked by name, as if created via "huckle create".
   
Note that an existing configuration file is left alone if the command is run multiple times
for the same CLI.
.IP "create <cliname>"
This allows you to create an alias into a new HCLI API. Manual configuration of the root HCLI URL
is required under ~/.huckle/etc/cliname/config.
.IP "cli <cliname>"
Used to invoke a CLI, the details of which are left to API implementers.
.IP "<cliname> ..."
The <cliname> alias created with huckle pull or huckle create can be used for brevity.
.IP "<cliname> ... help"
The "help" command can be used anywhere in a command line invocation to generate help pages from an HCLI document. This
is useful to explore what a CLI can do.

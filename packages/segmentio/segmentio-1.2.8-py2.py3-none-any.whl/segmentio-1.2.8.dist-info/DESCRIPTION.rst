Segment is the simplest way to integrate segmentio into your application.
One API allows you to turn on any other segmentio service. No more learning
new APIs, repeated code, and wasted development time.

This is a copy of the official library that renames the analytics module
segmentio.

This client wraps the the Segment REST API (https://segment.com).

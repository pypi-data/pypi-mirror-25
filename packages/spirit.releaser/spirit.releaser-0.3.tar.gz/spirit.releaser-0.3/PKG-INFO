        Exporting Diazo Themes as ZIP files
        -----------------------------------
        
        Plone allows us to upload diazo themes as zip files.
        This can be used when we don't have the permission to install our theme on the server as a python package (e.g. within a shared hosting environment).
        ``spirit.releaser`` provides a hook which is run after the release has been done.
        Use the following options in your ``setup.cfg`` to enable the ZIP file export::
        
            [spirit.releaser]
            diazo_export.enabled = 1
            diazo_export.path = src/my/package/diazo_resources
            diazo_export.adjust_title = 1
        
        diazo_export.enabled
            Activate or deactivate the export.
        
        diazo_export.path
            Path relative from the package root to the folder containing the diazo resource files.
        
        diazo_export.adjust_title
            Append the version number of the package to the title in the zipped ``manifest.cfg`` file.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Use in a buildout
        -----------------
        
        ::
        
            [buildout]
            parts += releaser
        
            [releaser]
            recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
            dependent-scripts = true
            eggs =
                spirit.releaser
                my.package
        
        If you want to use the latest development version from GitHub, add ``spirit.releaser`` to your ``mr.developer`` source section::
        
            [buildout]
            extensions += mr.developer
        
            [sources]
            spirit.releaser = git git@github.com:it-spirit/spirit.releaser.git
        
        
        This creates the ``zest.releaser`` executables in your bin-directory.
        Create a release as you're used to::
        
            $ ./bin/fullrelease
        
        
        Installation in a virtualenv
        ----------------------------
        
        You can also install ``spirit.releaser`` in a virtualenv.::
        
            $ pip install spirit.releaser
        
        You can also install the latest version of ``spirit.releaser`` directly from GitHub::
        
            $ pip install -e git+git@github.com:it-spirit/spirit.releaser.git#egg=spirit.releaser
        
        Now you can use it like this (when releasing your package)::
        
            $ fullrelease

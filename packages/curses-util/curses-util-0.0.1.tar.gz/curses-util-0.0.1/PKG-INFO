Description: Goals
        =====
        
        A collection of curses utils for performing simple UI tasks.
        Currently this includes a simple console and a menu with
        vi-like bindings.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Requires python 3.
        
        ``pip3 install curses-util`` should do the trick, or else
        ``python setup.py install`` from source.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Console
        -------
        
        
        Menu
        ----
        
        This can be used to vend a collection of items which the user may then
        select one or more of.  Navigation can be performed using standard vi
        bindings (count operands are also supported) or via the arrow
        keys. Multiple items can be selected if the user presses m over each
        of the items they wish to select and then presses enter.
        
        ::
        
           import curses_util
           
           menu = curses_util.Menu()
           
           items = [ str(i) for i in range(100) ]
           selected = menu.vend(items)
           
           print("The following items were selected: \n")
           print("\n".join(items), "\n")
            
        Bugs, etc..
        ===========
        
        If you bother to read the code and invariably feel the need to abuse
        the person who wrote it, know that such sentiments will be happily
        received at r.vaiya@gmail.com.

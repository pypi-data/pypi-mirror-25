How To Contribute
=====================

|PyInstaller| is an open-source project that is created and
maintained by volunteers.
At `Pyinstaller.org`_ you find links to the mailing list,
IRC channel, and Git repository,
and the important `How to Contribute`_ link.
Contributions to code and documentation are welcome,
as well as tested hooks for installing other packages.

.. note:: This section will be largely revised for the next release. You may
          want to sneek at the `manual for development version
          <https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html>`_
          meanwhile.

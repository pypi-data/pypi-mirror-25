# Work-around for a bug in execnet 1.4.1
git+https://github.com/pytest-dev/execnet.git

# For running tests
pytest >= 2.7.3  # Testing framework.
pytest-xdist     # Plugin allowing running tests in parallel.
pytest-timeout   # Plugin to abort hanging tests.
pytest-catchlog  # Capture log output separately from stdout/stderr
pytest-drop-dup-tests # allows specifying order without duplicates

# psutil 5.3.0 caused intermittent issues with the AppVeyor tests
psutil < 5.3.0 # Better subprocess alternative with implemented timeout.

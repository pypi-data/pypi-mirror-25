        ============================
        
        A Python client for `Raster Foundry <https://www.rasterfoundry.com/>`_, a web platform for combining, analyzing, and publishing raster data.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from rf.api import API
           refresh_token = '<>'
        
           api = API(refresh_token=refresh_token)
        
           # List all projects
           my_projects = api.projects
        
           one_project = my_projects[0]
        
           # Get TMS URl without token
           one_project.tms()
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ pip install rasterfoundry
        
        
        Testing
        -------
        
        The test suite execution process is managed by ``tox``:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ tox
        
        
        Releases
        --------
        
        Releases are automatically published to PyPI through Travis CI when commits are tagged. The following ``git flow`` commands lead to a tagged commit that can be pushed to GitHub:
        
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ git flow release start X.Y.Z
           $ vim CHANGELOG.rst
           $ vim setup.py
           $ git commit -m "X.Y.Z"
           $ git flow release publish X.Y.Z
           $ git flow release finish X.Y.Z
        
        
        After you've completed the ``git flow`` steps above, you'll need to push the changes from your local repository to the GitHub repository:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ git checkout develop
           $ git push origin develop
           $ git checkout master
           $ git push origin master
           $ git push --tags

Welcome to the modred project!

This is an easy-to-use and parallelized library for computing modal 
decompositions and reduced-order models.

Parallel implementations of the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced
POD (BPOD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and Petrov-Galerkin projection are
provided, as well as serial implementations of the Observer Kalman filter
Identification method (OKID) and the Eigensystem Realization Algorithm (ERA).
modred is applicable to a wide range of problems and to nearly any type of data.

For smaller and simpler datasets, there is a Matlab-like interface.  
For larger and more complicated datasets, you can provide modred with classes
and functions to interact with your data.

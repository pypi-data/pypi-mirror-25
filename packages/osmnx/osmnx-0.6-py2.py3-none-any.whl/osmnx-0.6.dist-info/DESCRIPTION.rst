**OSMnx** is a package to easily download, construct, project, visualize, and
analyze complex street networks from OpenStreetMap in Python with NetworkX.

You can get a city's or neighborhood's walking, driving, or biking network with
a single line of Python code. Then you can easily visualize cul-de-sacs or
one-way streets, plot shortest-path routes, or calculate stats like intersection
density, average node connectivity, betweenness centrality, etc.

See the examples and demos on `GitHub`_ or read more about `OSMnx`_.

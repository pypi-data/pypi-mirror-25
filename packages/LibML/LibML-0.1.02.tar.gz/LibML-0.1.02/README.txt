# MachineLearningLibrary
Implementations of various machine learning methods
## Classification methods
Logistic Regression using iteratively-reweighted least squares, conjugate gradients, Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (bfgs), and batch stochastic gradient descent <br/>
Rosenblatt's Perceptron <br/>
Both Quadratic and Linear Discriminant Analysis <br/> 
Multinomial and Bernoulli Naive Bayes
## Dependencies
General: numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn </br>
Specific: Linear Models have the option of showing learning rates, so matplotlib and seaborn are needed

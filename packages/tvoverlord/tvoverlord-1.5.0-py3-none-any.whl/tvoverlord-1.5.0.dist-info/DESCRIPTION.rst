TV Overlord is a command line tool to download and manage TV shows from
newsgroups or bittorent. It will download nzb files or magnet links.

It searches multiple sites simultaneously and combines the results
into one list to select from.

TV Overlord keeps track of which shows have been downloaded and what
shows are available to download.

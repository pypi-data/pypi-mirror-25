CleanerVersion is a solution that allows you to read and write multiple versions of an entry to and from your relational database. It allows to keep track of modifications on an object over time, as described by the theory of **Slowly Changing Dimensions** (SCD) **- Type 2**. CleanerVersion therefore enables a Django-based Datawarehouse, which was the initial idea of this package.

        When the query is built, this will enforce that the tables are joined and that
        the identity column and the as_of restriction is used for matching.

        For example, the generated SQL will be like:

           SELECT ... FROM foo INNER JOIN team ON (

        - the lookup value is not a Versionable (e.g. .filter(foo='bar') or .filter(team=non_versionable_team)

        Note that this has the effect that Foo.objects.as_of(t1).filter(team=team_object_at_t3) will
        return the Foo objects at t1, and that accessing their team field (e.g. foo.team) will return
        the team object that was associated with them at t1, which may be a different object than
        team_object_at_t3.

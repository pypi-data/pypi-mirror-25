Description: Sentry-VSTS
        ===============
        
        This is a plugin that can be installed on a Sentry.io server which is intended
        to allow a Sentry.io user to integrate issues reported in Sentry.io with Visual
        Studio Team Services work items.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install the plugin via ``pip``:
        
          pip install sentry_vsts
        
        
        Or optionally install directly from github:
        
          sudo -H pip install -e git+https://github.com/boylec/sentry-vsts#egg=sentry_vsts
        
        Once the plugin is installed, it will be configurable on a per-project basis
        within the Sentry.io UI. (Choose a project to integrate, and then go to project
        settings in the top right, and find the Visual Studio Team Services Plugin.
        Click configure and fill in configuration fields as needed.)

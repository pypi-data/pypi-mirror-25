Alerta Release 4.9
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/guardian/alerta.png)](https://travis-ci.org/guardian/alerta) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/alerta/chat.png)](https://gitter.im/alerta/chat)

The Alerta monitoring tool was developed with the following aims in mind:

*   distributed and de-coupled so that it is **SCALABLE**
*   minimal **CONFIGURATION** that easily accepts alerts from any source
*   quick at-a-glance **VISUALISATION** with drill-down to detail

Requirements
------------

The only mandatory dependency is MongoDB. Everything else is optional.

- MongoDB version 3.x

Optional
--------

A messaging transport that supports AMQP is required *if* it is wanted to send notifications
to alert subscribers. It is recommended to use RabbitMQ, but Redis and even MongoDB have been
tested and shown to work.

- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- MongoDB

Note: The default settings use MongoDB so that no additional configuration is required.

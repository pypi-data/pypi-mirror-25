-------------------------------------

IM is a tool that ease the access and the usability of IaaS clouds by automating
the VMI selection, deployment, configuration, software installation, monitoring
and update of Virtual Appliances. It supports APIs from a large number of
virtual platforms, making user applications cloud-agnostic. In addition it
integrates a contextualization system to enable the installation and
configuration of all the user required applications providing the user with a
fully functional infrastructure.

usage: client.py [-u|--xmlrpc-url <url>] [-a|--auth_file <filename>] operation op_parameters

Authentication File:

The authorization data is used to validate access to the components in the
infrastructure. This file is composed of a set of "key - value" pairs,
where the user specifies the authorization data for all the components and cloud
deployments available. File auth.dat shows examples of authorization data.

To avoid typing the parameters in all the client calls. The user can define a config
file "im_client.cfg" in the current directory or a file ".im_client.cfg" in their 
home directory. In the config file the user can specify the following parameters:

[im_client]
xmlrpc_url=http://localhost:8899
auth_file=auth.dat
xmlrpc_ssl=no
xmlrpc_ssl_ca_certs=/tmp/pki/ca-chain.pem

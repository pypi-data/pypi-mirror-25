A simple, low-overhead data management system for neural and behavioral
data. It helps you generate unique identifiers for stimuli, protocols, and
recording units. No more guessing what version of a stimulus you presented in an
experiment, where you stored an important recording, and whether you've backed
it all up yet. Your files are stored in a single directory hierarchy, and you
get nice, human-readable, JSON-based metadata to organize your records and
analysis workflows.

pypi-rpm
========

Placeholder package to make the RPM Python API available through PyPI.

Right now, this package just reserves the ``rpm`` name on PyPI to avoid
the potential for a name conflict with the ``python2-rpm`` and
``python3-rpm`` Python bindings on RPM-based Linux distros.

However, I eventually hope to replace it with a CMake-dependent PEP 517
backend that runs the full libdnf build process, and then emits a
statically linked completely self-contained extension module as part of
a wheel file (together with the pure Python components of the DNF Python
API).

Description: grid_instrument (aka Launchpad Scale-mode)
        ============
        
        Did you ever wish you could use your Launchpad as a MIDI controller? Do you covet the **scale mode** on the Launchpad Pro or Ableton Push, but not have the cash to buy them? Now you can play scales on any Novation Launchpad. 
        
        Here's a quick [video demo](https://youtu.be/JJA2fm-2NVg).
        
        At it's core, grid_instrument is a library that allows you to display a scale grid on your Novation Launchpad. It functions very similarly to the scale mode on Henri David's _fantastic_  [Launchpad95](http://motscousus.com/stuff/2011-07_Novation_Launchpad_Ableton_Live_Scripts/) scripts for Ableton Live, and also similarly to the [scale mode](https://global.novationmusic.com/launchpad-pro-scale-mode) on a Launchpad Pro.
        
        Features:
        
        * Can be used as a standalone app or incorporate into another Python project.
        * Key switching (you know, so that you're not stuck in the key of C)
        * Scale switching between the same 26 musical modes as Launchpad95
        * Works on Raspberry Pi and Mac OS (probably Windows, too, but not tested).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Before you try to do anything, make sure you have **Python 2** and **pip** install.
        
        ## How to use it as a standalone app

        Run the app:

Description: Cuthon is a simple Python script to avoid setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` when
        running python programs on a GPU. This tool is intended for a fairly niche
        use-case: running python programs on an interactive node which has more than
        one GPU. For those that have done this often you may be relieved at never
        having to run `nvidia-smi` followed by setting `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` again
        (when running a python program that is). This script should save you about 11.5 seconds
        per python program launch -- approximately the time it takes to run
        `nvidia-smi` followed by setting the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment
        variable. I hope you enjoy those seconds back as much as I have.

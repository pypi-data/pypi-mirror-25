Command: file upload

Usage: file upload <local source file> <remove destination>

Upload a file from the local filesystem to the remote filesystem.
If a full path is not specified for the remote destination, the current
working directory is assumed as the relative directory for the upload
destination.
If the file already exists on the remote filesystem, it will be overridden.

Examples:
   file upload test.sqlite Document/Preferences/test.sqlite

Command: ios hooking dump method_args

Usage: ios hooking dump method_args <+/-> <class_name> <method_name>

Dumps method invocations in real time, including the arguments used at the
time. This command tries its best to convert the arguments themselves into
readable data, but sometimes the pointers used are to data structures not
easily converted to readable formats.

When issuing this command, a few bits of information is needed to build up
the full class that should be hooked. The needed information includes:
   - A '+' or '-' indicating a class or instance method
   - The ClassName in question
   - The method name *including* the argument separators (':')

All of the information you need can be sourced with the `ios hooking list *`
commands, or using the 'class-dump' tool.

        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Rasa Core is a framework for building conversational software, which
        includes: - chatbots on Messenger - Slack bots - Alexa Skills - Google
        Home Actions
        
        etc.
        
        Rasa Core's primary purpose is to help you build contextual, layered
        conversations with lots of back-and-forth. To have a real conversation,
        you need to have some memory and build on things that were said earlier.
        Rasa Core lets you do that in a scalable way.
        
        There's a lot more background information in this `blog
        post <https://medium.com/rasa-blog/a-new-approach-to-conversational-software-2e64a5d05f2a>`__
        
        Where to get help
        -----------------
        
        There is extensive documentation:
        
        -  `master <https://core.rasa.ai/master/>`__  (if you install from
           **github**) or
        -  `stable <https://core.rasa.ai/>`__   (if you install from **pypi**)
        
        Please use `gitter <https://gitter.im/RasaHQ/rasa_core>`__ for quick
        answers to questions.
        
        README Contents:
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        -  `Setup <#setup>`__
        -  `How to contribute <#how-to-contribute>`__
        -  `Development Internals <#development-internals>`__
        -  `License <#license>`__
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        There isn't a released pypi package yet. Hence, you need to clone and
        install the package from the github repository. For a more detailed
        description, please visit the `**Installation
        page** <https://core.rasa.ai/installation.html>`__ of the docs.
        
        To install, run:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/RasaHQ/rasa_core.git
            cd rasa_core
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            pip install -e .
        
        Development Internals
        ---------------------
        
        Running and changing the documentation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        To build & edit the docs, first install all necessary dependencies:
        
        ::
        
            brew install sphinx
            pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
        
        After the installation has finished, you can run and view the
        documentation locally using
        
        ::
        
            make livedocs
        
        Visit the local version of the docs at http://localhost:8000 in your
        browser. You can now change the docs locally and the web page will
        automatically reload and apply your changes.

        Fixed
        -----
        
        [0.7.0] - 2017-10-04
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Added
        -----
        - support for Rasa Core usage as a server with remote action execution
        
        Changed
        -------
        - switched to max code line length 80
        - removed action id - use ``action.name()`` instead. if an action implementation overrides the name, it should include the ``action_`` prefix (as it is not automatically added anymore)
        - renamed ``rasa_dm.util`` to ``rasa_dm.utils``
        - renamed the whole package to ``rasa_core`` (so ``rasa_dm`` is gone!)
        - renamed ``Reminder`` attribute ``id`` to ``name``
        - a lot of documentation improvements. docs are now at https://core.rasa.ai
        
        [0.7.0a3] - 2017-09-20
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Changed
        -------
        - use hashing when writing memorized turns into persistence - requires retraining of all models that are trained with a version prior to this
        - changed ``agent.handle_message(...)`` interface for easier usage
        
        [0.6.0a1] - 2017-08-27
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Added
        -----
        - support for multiple policies (e.g. one memoization and a Keras policy at the same time)
        - loading domains from yaml files instead of defining them with python code
        - added an api layer (called ``Agent``) for you to use for 95% of the things you want to do (training, persistence, loading models)
        - support for reminders
        
        Changed
        -------
        - large refactoring of code base
        
        [0.5.0a1] - 2017-06-18
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Added
        -----
        - ``ScoringPolicy`` added to policy implementations (less strict than standard default policy)
        - ``RasaNLUInterpreter`` to run a nlu instance within dm (instead of using the http interface)
        - more tests
        
        Changed
        -------
        - ``UserUtterance`` now holds the complete parse data from nlu (e.g. to access attributes other than entities or intent)
        - ``Turn`` has a reference to a ``UserUtterance`` instead of directly storing intent & entities (allows access to other data)
        - Simplified interface of output channels
        - order of actions in the DefaultPolicy in ``possible_actions`` (``ActionListen`` now always has index 0)
        
        Fixed
        -----
        - ``RedisTrackerStore`` checks if tracker is stored before accessing it (otherwise a ``None`` access exception is thrown)
        - ``RegexInterpreter`` checks if the regex actually matches the message instead of assuming it always does
        - ``str`` implementation for all events
        - ``Controller`` can be started without an input channel (e.g. messages need to be fed into the queue manually)
        
        [0.2.0a1] - 2017-05-18

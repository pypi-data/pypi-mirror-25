Description: Editobj3
        ========
        
        Editobj3 is an automatic dialog box generator for Python objects. It supports several backends; currenlty
        Qt, GTK and HTML are supported. The HTML backend is based on `W2UI <http://w2ui.com>`_, and can be used
        either in local single user mode, or in distributed multiple users mode.
        
        Editobj3 dialog boxes are composed of an attribute list, a luxurious good-looking but useless icon and
        title bar, and a tree view (if the edited object is part of a tree-like structure). Editobj3 includes an
        advanced introspection module that usually guesses how to edit any object; it can also be customized for a
        given class of object through the editobj3.introsp module. Editobj3 also supports the simultaneous
        edition of a group of objects, as if they were a single object.
        
        Additional helper modules are included:
        
         - editobj3.observe: Observation framework
        
         - editobj3.undoredo: Multiple undo/redo framework
        
         - editobj3.http_ws_server: HTTP server with WebSocket support, with an interface similar to Python's http.server module
        
        Editobj3 has been created by Jean-Baptiste Lamy. It is available under the GNU LGPL licence.

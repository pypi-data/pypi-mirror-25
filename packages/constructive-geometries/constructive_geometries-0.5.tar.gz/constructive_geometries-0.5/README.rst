Constructive Geometries - Python library
========================================

Simple tools to define world locations from a set of topological faces and set algebra. For example, one could define a "rest of the world" which started from all countries, but excluded every country who name started with the letter "a".

Builds on top of `constructive geometries <https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/constructive-geometries>`__.

No requirements for basic use, but needs `shapely <https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely>`__, and `fiona <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona>`__ for any GIS functions.

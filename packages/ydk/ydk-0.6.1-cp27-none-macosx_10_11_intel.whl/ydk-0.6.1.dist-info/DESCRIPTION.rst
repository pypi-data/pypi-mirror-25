The YANG Development Kit (YDK) is a Software Development Kit
that provides API's that are modeled in YANG. The main goal
of YDK is to reduce the learning curve of YANG data models by
expressing the model semantics in an API and abstracting
protocol/encoding details. YDK is composed of a core package
that defines services and providers, plus one or more module
bundles that are based on YANG models.

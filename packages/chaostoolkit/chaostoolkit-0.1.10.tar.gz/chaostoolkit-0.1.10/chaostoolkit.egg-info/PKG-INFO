        A chaos engineering toolkit for your system and microservices.
        
        ## Context and Purpose
        
        The chaostoolkit aims at making it simple and straightforward to run
        experiments against your live system to observe its behavior and learn about
        potential weaknesses.
        
        The idea is that your system is complex and no matter how well you planned
         and designed, it would be challenging to claim anyone knows how it would 
         react under certain conditions.
        
        Following in the steps of giants like Netflix or LinkedIn, we believe in the
        [principles of chaos engineering][principles]. Creating the conditions to
        stress your system should help your team become better at handling those
        situations while allowing your system to evolve nicely.
        
        [principles]: http://principlesofchaos.org/
        
        The chaostoolkit is, as its name implies, a toolkit for you to run those
        experiments at the platform and/or application level. For instance, by killing
        a microservice, your experiment could probe the system for other services and
        see the impact of tsuch a failure.
        
        The goal is not to break things, though this is one way to run an experiment,
        but to create the conditions of stress that can make you learn from your system.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        chaostoolkit is a command line tool that runs your experiment, then 
        generates a report to share with your team for discussion.
        
        Running an experiment is as simple as:
        
        ```
        $ chaos run experiment.json
        ```
        
        chaostoolkit takes your experiment as a description file, encoded in JSON, and
        runs its steps sequentially.
        
        Please, read the main documentation to [install chaostoolkit][install] and 
        learn more about it.

        ## Learn More
        
        chaostoolkit is open and you are more than welcome to discuss and share your
        experiments with its community.

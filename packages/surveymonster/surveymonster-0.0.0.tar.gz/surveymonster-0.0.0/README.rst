surveymonster
#############

SurveyMonster is a work-in-progress project to create an automated system to construct surveys which yield some desired bias in their responses. Evil, right? :)

The project is meant as a demonstration on the weakness of possible naive surveying methods, and on the importance of proper methodologies and tools for more statistically and scietificly sound surveys, like the `SurveyMan <http://surveyman.emmatosch.com/>`_ tool.

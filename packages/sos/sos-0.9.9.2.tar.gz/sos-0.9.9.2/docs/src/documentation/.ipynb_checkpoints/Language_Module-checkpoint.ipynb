    "To support a new language, you will need to write a Python package that defines a class, say `mylanguage`, that should provide the following class attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `supported_kernels`: a dictionary of language and names of the kernels that the language supports, such as `{'R': ['ir']}`. If multiple kernels are supported, SoS will look for a kernel with matched name in the order that is specified (e.g. `{'JavaScript': ['ijavascript', 'inodejs']}`). Multiple languages can be specified if a language module supports multiple languages (e.g. `Matlab` and `Octave`).\n",
    "2. `background_color`: a name or `#XXXXXX` value for a color that will be used in the prompt area of cells that are executed by the subkernel. An empty string can be used for using default notebook color.\n",
    "3. `options`: A Python dictionary with options that will be passed to the frontend. Currently two options `variable_pattern` and `assignment_pattern` are supported. Both options should be regular expressions in JS style. \n",
    "   * Option `variable_pattern` is used to identify if a statement is a simple variable (nothing else). If this option is defined and the input text (if executed at the side panel) matches the pattern, SoS will prepend `%preview` to the code. This option is useful only when `%preview var` displays more information than `var`.\n",
    "   * Option `assignment_pattern` is used to identify if a statement is an assignment operation. If this option is defined and the input text matches the pattern, SoS will prepend `%preview var` to the code where `var` should be the first matched portion of the pattern (use `( )`). This mechanism allows SoS to automatically display result of an assignment when you step through the code.\n",
    "   \n",
    "An instance of the class would be initialized with the sos kernel and the name of the subkernel, which does not have to be one of the `supported_kernels` (could be self-defined) and should provide the following attributes and functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `init_statements`: a statement that will be executed by the sub-kernel when the kernel starts. This statement usually defines functions to convert object to Python.\n",
    "2. `get_vars`: a Python function that transfer a Python variable to the subkernel.\n",
    "3. `put_vars`: a Python function that put one or more variables in the subkernel to SoS or another subkernel.\n",
    "4. `sessioninfo`: a Python function that returns information of the running kernel, usually including version of the language, the kernel, and currently used packages and their versions. For `R`, this means a call to `sessionInfo()` function. The return value of this function can be a string, a list of strings or `(key, value)` pairs, or a dictinary. The function will be called by the `%sessioninfo` magic of SoS.\n"

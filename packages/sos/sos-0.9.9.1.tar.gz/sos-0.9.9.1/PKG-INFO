Description: Exploratory data analysis in computationally intensive disciplines such as computational
        biology often requires one to exploit a variety of tools implemented in different programming
        languages and analyzing large datasets on high performance computing systems (e.g. computer
        clusters). On top of all the difficulties in exchanging data between languages and computing
        systems and analyzing data on different platforms, it becomes challenging to keep track of
        such fragmented workflows and reproduce prior analyses.
        
        With strong emphases on readability, practicality, and reproducibility, we have developed
        a workflow system called "Script of Scripts" (SoS) with a web front-end and notebook format
        based on Jupyter. Major features of SoS for exploratory analysis include multi-language
        support, explicit and automatic data exchange between running sessions (kernels) in
        different languages, cell-specific kernel switch using frontend-UI or cell magics,
        a side-panel that allows scratch execution of statements, preview of files and expressions,
        and line-by-line execution of statements in cells. In particular, variable and file preview
        on the side panel makes it possible to trouble-shoot scripts in multiple languages without
        contaminating the main notebook or interrupting the logic flow of the analysis. For large-scale
        data analysis, the SoS workflow engine provides a unified interface to executing and managing
        tasks on a variety of computing platforms such as PBS/Torch/LSF/Slurm clusters and RQ and
        Celery task queues. Specified files are automatically synchronized between file systems,
        thus enabling a single workflow to utilize multiple remote computing environments.
        
        Researchers will benefit from the SoS system the flexibility to use their preferred languages
        and tools for tasks without having to worry about data flow, and can perform light interactive
        analysis while executing heavy remote tasks simultaneous in the same notebook in a neat and
        organized fashion. SoS is available at http://vatlab.github.io/SOS/ and is distributed freely
        under a GPL3 license. A live Jupyter server and several docker containers are available for
        testing and running SoS without a local installation.

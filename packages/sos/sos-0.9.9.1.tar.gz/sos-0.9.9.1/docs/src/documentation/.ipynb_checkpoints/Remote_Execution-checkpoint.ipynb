    "Based on a host configuration system that defines ways to communicate with remote hosts, SoS allows you to execute complete or part of workflows on remote servers or task queues. Here we define\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **host** as a local or remote machine that can be accessed with commands such as `scp`, `ssh`, and `rsync`.\n",
    "* A **queue** as a task queue such as [PBS](http://www.pbspro.org/), [Torque](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/), [IBM LSF](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSETD4/product_welcome_platform_lsf.html), and [RQ](http://python-rq.org/) on a local or remote host that can queue and execute tasks. Direct execution of tasks on remote hosts is also considered a queue so any host can be used as a task queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to execute workflows on a remote host,\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `sos run -r HOST` (or `%run -r` or `%sosrun -r` in Jupyter) to copy a script to remote host and execute the entire workflow remotely. All input and dependent files should be on remote host, and result files are not sychronized to local host.\n",
    "* Use `sos run -q QUEUE` (or `%run -q` or `%sosrun -q` in Jupyter) to submit individual **tasks** of workflows to remote task queues. The workflow is still executed locally. Input, output, and dependent files of tasks will be synchronized to the remote host if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two methods could be used in combination if the remote host is configured to be able to submit tasks to a local task queue or to a third host."

    "1. Set up public key authentication between local and remote host so that you can log in to remote host without being prompted for password.\n",
    "2. Install SoS on both local and remote hosts.\n",
    "3. Make sure you have `ssh`, `scp`, and `rsync` installed on local host. For windows, you might want to install these tools with [msys2](http://www.msys2.org/) or enable Ubuntu Linux Shell (windows 10 only, need to turn on developer mode).\n",

You can also put your settings in any configuration file and specify it with option `-c`. `~/.sos/hosts.yml` is designed to record all host-related configurations and should be used for this purpose.\n",

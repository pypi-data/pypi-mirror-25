Description: libemd is an open-source Python library for the empirical mode
        decomposition signal processing technique and it's variations.
        
        Lots of other packages exist for EMD in Python. So why should you use
        libemd?
        
          - libemd is an original Pythonic implementation of the algorithm. 
            Other existing libraries borrow heavily from unlicensed Matlab
            source code without attribution. libemd does not.
        
          - libemd has Cython implementations of the algorithms in its roadmap,
            specifically designed for use cases with high sampling frequencies
            that demand performance.
        
          - libemd ships with a permissive, compatible open-source license.

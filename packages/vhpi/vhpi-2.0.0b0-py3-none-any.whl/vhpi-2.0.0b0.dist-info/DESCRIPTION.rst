## <a name="description"></a> Description
With **vhpi** you can turn your Raspberry Pi into a silent backup module for your Network.
*Vhpi* creates [incremental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_backup) [snapshot](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation) backups of available network shares (e.g. [NFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), [Samba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software))) silently and automated with a minimum of disk space required.
*Vhpi* runs entirely on 'server-side'; clients only need to share/export backup sources with the Pi and let the Pi run the backups in the background. 
*Vhpi* uses battle proven tools like [rsync](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) to create the backups and [cp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cp_(Unix)) to create hardlinks for the snapshots. 
To get the most control over the backups *vhpi* takes raw [rsync options](http://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync) for configuration.
*Vhpi* writes two log files: one for a short overview of the entire process ([info.log exmpl.](vhpi/examples/info.log)) and one for debugging ([debug.log exmpl.](vhpi/examples/debug.log)).

More details about the script in the wiki: ['What the script does in detail'](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/What-the-script-does-in-detail).

**TL;DR:** Just setup *vhpi*, run your Pi 24/7 and don't care about backups no more.
<br>

## <a name="features"></a> Features

* *Vhpi* works with any rsync command you like. This gives you a wide and well documented variety of configuration options for your backup.
* You can create multiple *exclude-lists* to exclude files/dirs from the backup. (See 'exclude_lib' in [Example Config](#example_config))
* *Vhpi* creates [snapshots](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Snapshots-explanation) for any time-interval you like. (e.g. 'hourly', 'daily', 'weekly', 'monthly', 'each-4-hours', 'half-yearly', etc...) Just add the interval name and its duration in seconds to the config. (See 'intervals' in [Example Config](#example_config)).
* You can set the amount of snapshots that you want keep for each used interval.
    E.g. if you want to keep 3 snapshots for the 'hourly' interval you get three snapshot dirs: `hourly.0`, `hourly.1`, `hourly.2`. Each snapshot reaches an hour further into the past.
* Snapshots require a minimum of disk space:
    * because the backups are created incrementally. 
    * because *vhpi* creates new snapshots as 'hard links' for all files that haven't changed. (No duplicate files.. just links)
* The process is nicely logged ('info.log', 'debug.log').
* If a backup process takes long, *vhpi* blocks any attempt to start a new backup process until the first one has finished to prevent the Pi from overloading.
* More features are planned (See: [Version Overview](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Version-Overview-(TODOs)))

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements:

* You need Python >= 3.6 on your Pi for *vhpi* to run. ([How to install Python3.x on your Pi](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)))
* The file system of your Backup destination has to support hard links. (most common fs like NTFS and ext do...)

## <a name="install"></a> Installation & Configuration


### Sharing sources with the Pi:

Your Pi needs access to the directories of each client that you want to backup. Just share/export them with `NFS` or `Samba` (There are plenty tutorials for this on the www).
Perhaps *vhpi* can create local backups as well.

You should use `autofs` or similar to automatically mount the shared directories with your Pi whenever they are available. This way your Pi will automatically mount the directories whenever a machine enters the network.


### Download and Install:

Simplest way to install *vhpi* is by useing pip. You need Python3.6 for *vhpi* to run. ([How to install Python3.x on your Pi](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/wiki/Install-Python3.X-from-source-on-a-Raspberry-Pi-(Raspbian)))
After you installed Python3.6 you can run pip to install *vhpi* like this:
```
$ pip3.6 install vhpi
```

Run this command to check if *vhpi* was isntalled successfully:

```
$ vhpi --help
```
It should print the help text to the terminal.


### Configure vhpi:

When you run *vhpi* for the first time, it creates a config dir at `~/.config/vhpi/`, you'll find a file called `vhpi_cfg.yaml` there. This is where you configure your backups. The config file is pretty self explanatory, just have a look at the [Example Config](#example_config)


### Test the configuration 

In order to test *vhpi* I suggest setting up some dummy backup sources that point to some safe destinations. Maybe in the `/tmp` dir or so. Then just run the following command a couple of times and see if the destination gets filled with backups/snapshots, the way you wish:

 ```
 $ vhpi run
 ```

If you get an error try to adjust the config. If you think there is a bug feel free to use the [github issue tracker](https://github.com/feluxe/very_hungry_pi/issues)!
The results of each run is written to the log-files as well (`~/.config/vhpi/debug.log` and `~/.config/vhpi/info.log`)

### <a name="create_cronjob"></a> Create a Cronjob

I suggest creating a cronjob that runs *vhpi* automatically every hour. To do so you can add the following line to `/etc/crontab`. (Replace `username` with the username that is supposed to run *vhpi*.

```
@hourly         username   vhpi run
```

*NOTICE: You can use any time interval you like for the cronjob, but keep in mind that the time interval should be at least as small as the smallest snapshot interval that you use. E.g. if you want to create hourly snapshots the cronjob should run *vhpi* at least every hour, otherwise you won't get a snapshot for each hour.
 You should also keep in mind that the more frequently *vhpi* is run by your cronjob, the higher is the chance you get a new backup. E.g. if you use a cronjob that only starts every 24 hours, chances are high that you won't get a backup for several days in a row, because your client machines might be offline at the particular time your cronjob fires. So even if your smallest snapshot is supposed to happen daily, you should consider making the cronjob run *vhpi* each hour or so. That way chances are higher that you get a daily backup.* <br>
 **TL;DR** Run it hourly.

You can also add multiple cronjobs that execute *vhpi* in different intervals for different users.

After you added the cronjob, you should restart your Pi or restart the crontab like this:

```
$ /etc/init.d/cron restart
```

If this is all done, your Pi should run *vhpi* every hour and you should see some activity in the log files and of cause on your hard drive. Yay! :D

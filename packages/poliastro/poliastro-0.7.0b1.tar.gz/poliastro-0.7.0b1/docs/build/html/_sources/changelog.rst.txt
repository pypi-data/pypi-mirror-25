==========

poliastro 0.7.0b1 - 2017-09-07
------------------------------

This is a new major release, which adds new packages and modules,
besides fixing several issues.

New features:
.............

* **NEOS package**: a new package has been added to poliastro, :py:mod:`~poliastro.neos`
  package. It provides several ways of getting NEOs (Near Earth Objects) data from NASA
  databases, online and offline.
* **New patched conics module**. New module containing a function to compute
  the radius of the Sphere of Influence (SOI).
* **Use Astropy for body ephemerides**. Instead of downloading the SPK
  files ourselves, now we use Astropy builtin capabilities. This also
  allows the user to select a builtin ephemerides that does not require
  external downloads. See `#131`_ for details.
* **Coordinates module**: new module containing transformations between ICRS
  and body-centered frame, and perifocal to body_centered, :py:mod:`~poliastro.coordinates`.
* **Pip packaging**: troublesome dependencies have been released in wheel format,
  so poliastro can now be installed using pip from all platforms.
* **Legend plotting**: now label and epoch are in a figure legend, which ends with
  the ambiguity of the epochs when having several plots in the same figure.

Other highlights:
.................

* **Joined Open Astronomy**: we are now part of `Open Astronomy`_, a
  collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects
  to share resources, ideas, and to improve code.
* **New constants module**: poliastro has now a :py:mod:`~poliastro.constants` module,
  with GMs and radii of solar system bodies.
* **Added Jupyter examples**: poliastro examples are now available in the
  documentation as Jupyter notebooks, thanks to `nbsphinx`_.
* **New Code of Conduct**: poliastro community now has a Code of conduct.
* **Documentation update**: documentation has been updated with new installation
  ways, propagation and NEOs examples, "refactored" code and images, improved contribution
  guidelines and intersphinx extension.
* **New success stories**: two new success stories have been added to documentation.
* **Bodies now have a parent**. It is now possible to specify the attractor
  of a body.
* **Relative definition of Bodies**. Now it is possible to define Body parameters
  with respect to another body, and also add any number of properties in a simple
  way.

.. _`Issue #130`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/130

Backward incompatible changes:
..............................

* **Non-osculating orbits**: removed support for non-osculating orbits.
  :code:`plotting.plot()` calls containing :code:`osculating` parameter should be
  replaced.

poliastro 0.6.0 - 2017-02-12
----------------------------

This major release was focused on refactoring some internal core
parts and improving the propagation functionality.

Highlights:
...........

* **Support Python 3.6**. See `#144`_.
* **Introduced ``Orbit`` objects** to replace ``State`` ones. The latter
  has been simplified, reducing some functionality, now their API
  has been moved to the former. See the User Guide and the examples for
  updated explanations. See `#135`_.
* **Allow propagation functions to receive a callback**. This paves the
  way for better plotting and storage of results. See `#140`_.

.. _`#144`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/144

poliastro 0.5.0 - 2016-03-06
----------------------------

This is a new major release, focused on expanding the initial orbit
determination capabilities and solving some infrastructure challenges.

New features:
.............

* **Izzo's algorithm for the Lambert problem**: Thanks to this algorithm
  multirevolution solutions are also returned. The old algorithm is kept
  on a separate module.

Other highlights:
.................

* **Documentation on Read the Docs**: You can now browse previous releases
  of the package and easily switch between released and development versions.
* **Mailing list**: poliastro now has a mailing list hosted on groups.io.
  Come and join!
* **Clarified scope**: poliastro will now be focused on interplanetary
  applications, leaving other features to the new `python-astrodynamics`_
  project.

.. _`python-astrodynamics`: http://python-astrodynamics.org/

Bugs fixed:
...........

* `Issue #110`_: Bug when plotting State with non canonical units

.. _`Issue #110`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/110

Backward incompatible changes:
..............................

* **Drop Legacy Python**: poliastro 0.5.x and later will support only
  Python 3.x. We recommend our potential users to create dedicated virtual
  environments using conda or virtualenv or to contact the developers to fund
  Python 2 support.
* **Change ``lambert`` function API**: The functions for solving Lambert's
  problem are now _generators_, even in the single revolution case.
  Check out the User Guide for specific examples.
* **Creation of orbits from classical elements**: poliastro has
  reverted the switch to the *semilatus rectum* \\(p\\) instead of the semimajor
  axis \\(a\\) made in 0.4.0, so \\(a\\) must be used again. This change is
  definitive.

poliastro 0.4.2 - 2015-12-24
----------------------------

Fixed packaging problems.

poliastro 0.4.0 - 2015-12-13
----------------------------

This is a new major release, focused on improving stability and code quality.
New angle conversion and modified equinoctial elements functions were added
and an important backwards incompatible change was introduced related to
classical orbital elements.

New features:
.............

* **Angle conversion functions**: Finally brought back from poliastro 0.1,
  new functions were added to convert between true \\(\\nu\\), eccentric
  \\(E\\) and mean \\(M\\) anomaly, see `#45`_.
* **Equinoctial elements**: Now it's possible to convert between classical
  and equinoctial elements, as well as from/to position and velocity vectors,
  see `#61`_.
* **Numerical propagation**: A new propagator using
  SciPy Dormand & Prince 8(5,3) integrator was added, see `#64`_.

.. _`#45`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/45
.. _`#61`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/61
.. _`#64`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/64

Other highlights:
.................

* **MIT license**: The project has been relicensed to a more popular license.
  poliastro remains commercial-friendly through a permissive, OSI-approved
  license.
* **Python 3.5 and NumPy 1.10 compatibility**. poliastro retains compatibility
  with legacy Python (Python 2) and NumPy 1.9. *Next version will be Python 3
  only*.

Bugs fixed:
...........

* `Issue #62`_: Conversion between coe and rv is not transitive
* `Issue #69`_: Incorrect plotting of certain closed orbits

.. _`Issue #62`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/62
.. _`Issue #69`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/69

Backward incompatible changes:
..............................

* **Creation of orbits from classical elements**: poliastro has
  switched to the *semilatus rectum* \\(p\\) instead of the semimajor
  axis \\(a\\) to define ``State`` objects, and the function has been renamed
  to :py:meth:`~poliastro.twobody.State.from_classical`. Please update your
  programs accordingly.
* Removed specific angular momentum \\(h\\) property to avoid a name clash
  with the fourth modified equinoctial element, use ``norm(ss.h_vec)``
  instead.

poliastro 0.3.1 - 2015-06-30
----------------------------

This is a new minor release, with some bug fixes backported from the main
development branch.

Bugs fixed:
...........

* Fixed installation problem in Python 2.
* `Issue #49`_: Fix velocity units in ``ephem``.
* `Issue #50`_: Fixed ``ZeroDivisionError`` when propagating with time zero.

.. _`Issue #50`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/50

poliastro 0.3.0 - 2015-05-09
----------------------------

This is a new major release, focused on switching to a pure Python codebase.
Lambert problem solving and ephemerides computation came back, and a couple
of bugs were fixed.

New features:
.............

* **Pure Python codebase**: Forget about Fortran linking problems and
  nightmares on Windows, because now poliastro is a pure Python package.
  A new dependency, numba, was introduced to accelerate the algorithms,
  but poliastro will use it only if it is installed.
* **Lambert problem solving**: New module :py:mod:`~poliastro.iod` to
  determine an orbit given two position vectors and the time of flight.
* `PR #42`_: **Planetary ephemerides computation**: New module
  :py:mod:`~poliastro.ephem` with functions to deal with SPK files and
  compute position and velocity vectors of the planets.
* `PR #38`_: New method :py:meth:`~poliastro.twobody.State.parabolic` to create parabolic orbits.
* New conda package: visit `poliastro binstar channel`_!
* New organization and logo.

.. _`PR #38`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/pull/38

.. _`poliastro binstar channel`: https://binstar.org/poliastro

Bugs fixed:
...........

* `Issue #19`_: Fixed plotting region for parabolic orbits.
* `Issue #37`_: Fixed creation of parabolic orbits.

.. _`Issue #19`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/19
.. _`Issue #37`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/37

poliastro 0.2.1 - 2015-04-26
----------------------------

This is a bugfix release, no new features were introduced since 0.2.0.

* Fixed `#35`_ (failing tests with recent astropy versions), thanks to
  Sam Dupree for the bug report.
* Updated for recent Sphinx versions.

.. _`#35`: https://github.com/poliastro/poliastro/issues/35

poliastro 0.2 - 2014-08-16
--------------------------

* **Totally refactored code** to provide a more pythonic API (see `PR #14`_
  and `wiki`_ for further information) heavily inspired by `Plyades`_ by
  Helge Eichhorn.

  * Mandatory use of **physical units** through :code:`astropy.units`.
  * Object-oriented approach: :py:class:`~poliastro.twobody.State` and
    :py:class:`~poliastro.maneuver.Maneuver` classes.
  * Vector quantities: results not only have magnitude now, but also direction
    (see for example maneuvers).

* Easy plotting of orbits in two dimensions using matplotlib.
* Module :code:`example` with sample data to start testing the library.

.. _Plyades: https://github.com/helgee/Plyades

These features were removed temporarily not to block the release and will
see the light again in poliastro 0.3:

* Conversion between anomalies.
* Ephemerides calculations, will look into Skyfield and the JPL ephemerides
  prepared by Brandon Rhodes (see `issue #4`_).
* Lambert problem solving.
* Perturbation analysis.

==================
Installation guide
==================

DucoBox is packaged with pip, but once installed it offers
direct command line invocation (no need to run python infront). That is why
installation is as simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Python2
    pip2 install duco.ducobox

    # Python3
    pip3 install duco.ducobox

    # Install latest and greatest
    pip install https://github.com/SteinHeselmans/DucoBox/archive/master.zip

So far we are not aware of any problems with installation of the plugin, but in
case you have any please open the Issue.

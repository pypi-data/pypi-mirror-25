Description: Conference Scehduler Command Line Interface
        ===========================================
        A command line tool to manage the schedule for a conference.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        The library requires Python 3.6 or later. The simplest way to install is::
        
            pip install conference-scheduler-cli
        
        To install from source code::
        
            git clone https://github.com/PyConUK/ConferenceScheduler-cli
            cd ConferenceScheduler-cli
            python setup.py install
        
        Quick Start
        ===========
        
        The tool expects to find a directory with the necessary data files to define
        the conference. By default it will look for a directory named `input` under
        the current working directory.
        
        It will generate YAML files in the format required by the conference
        website. By default, these will be placed a in a `build` directory under the
        current working directory.
        
        It will also generate `.csv` and `.pickle` files to store the calculated
        schedule and its associated definition and a log file with the full details of
        the most recent calculation. By default, these will be placed in a
        `solution` directory under the current working directory.
        
        The `input`, `solution` and `build` directories can be passed to the tool as
        command line options in place of the default locations.
        
        To build the schedule with the default options::
        
            scheduler build
        
        There are also further options, e.g. to set the logging verbosity or the
        solver algorithm to use. To view those options::
        
            scheduler --help
        
        or, for the options for a specifc command::
        
            scheduler build --help

LXDock is a wrapper around LXD_ that allows developers to orchestrate their development environments
using a workflow similar to Vagrant.

Why use LXDock?
===============

**It's fast.** LXDock is much *much* faster than a typical Vagrant + Virtualbox setup.

**Multi-arch.** Vagrant has been designed with Virtualbox and x86 in mind. Even if you use
alternative providers, you're going to have to jump through inelegant hoops to have your
``Vagrantfile`` work on x86 and arm (for example) at the same time because the very concept of a
Vagrant box is arch-specific.

**Simpler.** When working with containers, much of the complexity of Vagrant becomes useless. Why
the need for special "vagrant-prepared" boxes when ``lxc exec`` is available? It's much simpler to
use whatever images are provided directly by lxd. By removing the need to manage boxes, ``lxdock``
suddenly becomes much simpler (a simple wrapper around lxd, really).

Documentation
=============

Online browsable documentation is available at https://lxdock.readthedocs.io.

        Marrow Mongo is a collection of small, focused utilities written to enhance use of the `PyMongo native MongoDB driver
        <http://api.mongodb.com/python/current/>`__ without the overhead, glacial update cycle, complexity, and head-space
        requirements of a full active record object document mapper. Additionally, it provides a very light-weight database
        connection plugin for the `WebCore web framework <https://github.com/marrow/WebCore>`__ and Python standard logging
        adapter to emit logs to MongoDB.
        
        Additional documentation is provided in the form of an `online reference manual <https://mongo.webcore.io/>`__.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installing ``marrow.mongo`` is easy, just execute the following in a terminal::
        
            pip install marrow.mongo
        
        **Note:** We *strongly* recommend always using a container, virtualization, or sandboxing environment of some kind when
        developing using Python; installing things system-wide is yucky (for a variety of reasons) nine times out of ten.  We
        prefer light-weight `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html>`__, others prefer solutions as
        robust as `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`__.
        
        If you add ``marrow.mongo`` to the ``install_requires`` argument of the call to ``setup()`` in your application's
        ``setup.py`` file, marrow.mongo will be automatically installed and made available when your own application or
        library is installed.  We recommend using "less than" version numbers to ensure there are no unintentional
        side-effects when updating.  Use ``marrow.mongo<1.2`` to get all bugfixes for the current release, and
        ``marrow.mongo<2.0`` to get bugfixes and feature updates while ensuring that large breaking changes are not installed.
        
        This package has a few dependencies:
        
        * Python 2.7 and above, or Python 3.2 and above, or compatible such as Pypy or Pypy3.
        * A modern (>3.2) version of the ``pymongo`` package.
        * The Marrow Package and Schema utility packages for plugin handling and declarative syntax support.
        
        Additional instructions on `conditional dependencies, package flags, and development version utilization
        <https://mongo.webcore.io/installation.html>`__ are available in the manual.

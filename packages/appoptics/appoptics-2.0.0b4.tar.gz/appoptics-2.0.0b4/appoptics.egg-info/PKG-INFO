        # python-appoptics
        
        The 'appoptics' module provides support for instrumenting
        programs for use with the AppOptics instrumentation library.
        
        The appoptics module provides a Pythonic interface to liboboe for C, and middleware 
        and other components for popular web frameworks such as Django, Tornado, Pyramid, and WSGI.
        
        
        ## Installing
        
        The Python instrumentation for AppOptics uses a module named `appoptics`, which you
        can get from pip by running:
        
        ```sh
        pip install appoptics
        ```
        
        ## Configuring
        
        See our documentation on [configuring AppOptics for python](http://docs.appoptics.com/Instrumentation/python.html#configuring-instrumentation).
        
        # Upgrading
        
        To upgrade an existing installation, you simply need to run:
        
        ```sh
        pip install appoptics --upgrade
        ```
        
        ## Running the Tests
        
        ### Test dependencies
        
        The test suite depends on the presence of several database and cache servers.
        
        - mysql
        - postgres
        - mongodb
        - memcached
        - redis
        
        The test suite uses [tox](https://testrun.org/tox/latest/), a tool for running
        tests against different versions of python and depended modules. You can get it
        from apt by running `sudo apt-get install python-tox` or from pip with
        `sudo pip install tox`.
        
        The tests currently run against python 2.6 and 2.7, so you will need both.
        
        To set up multiple versions of python:
        
            sudo apt-get install python-software-properties software-properties-common
            sudo add-apt-repository ppa:fkrull/deadsnakes
            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install python2.6 python2.6-dev
        
        ### Configuring test database and cache servers
        
        MySQL SQLAlchemy tests require no-auth TCP connection (as testing user).
        
        PostgreSQL SQLAlchemy tests requires no-auth (trust) TCP connection (as testing user).
        
        ```
        # in pg_hba.conf: Don't use this in production!!
        host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
        ```
        
        ### Running the tests
        
        To run tests, simply run:
        
        ```sh
        tox
        ```
        
        ### Test directory layout
        
        Tests in test/unit are actually functional tests; naming is for historic
        reasons.  Tests in test/manual are for manual verification of certain
        behaviors.
        
        ## Support
        
        If you find a bug or would like to request an enhancement, feel free to file
        an issue. For all other support requests, please email support@appoptics.com.
        
        ## Contributing
        
        You are obviously a person of great sense and intelligence. We happily
        appreciate all contributions to the appoptics module whether it is documentation,
        a bug fix, new instrumentation for a library or framework or anything else
        we haven't thought of.
        
        We welcome you to send us PRs. We also humbly request that any new
        instrumentation submissions have corresponding tests that accompany
        them. This way we don't break any of your additions when we (and others)
        make changes after the fact.
        
        ## Developer Resources
        
        We have made a large effort to expose as much technical information
        as possible to assist developers wishing to contribute to the AppOptics module.
        Below are the three major sources for information and help for developers:
        
        * The [AppOptics Knowledge Base](https://docs.appoptics.com/)
        has a large collection of technical articles or, if needed, you can submit a
        support request directly to the team.
        
        If you have any questions or ideas, don't hesitate to contact us anytime.

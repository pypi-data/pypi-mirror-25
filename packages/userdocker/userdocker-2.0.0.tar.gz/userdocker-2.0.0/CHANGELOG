Version 2.0.0
=============

This is a major release.

Backwards incompatibilities:
----------------------------

- VOLUME_MOUNT config vars could previously include {USER} and {HOME} strings.
  This is now replaced by user_name and user_home python variables that can be
  used throughout all config files (and in all settings, not only mounts).
- HOME env var in containers is set to user_home by default now.
- Executor nvidia-docker now includes configurable limits to NV_GPU env var.
  Before the default was to always make all GPUs available (see new config
  options below).
- PRIVILEGED dropped (use ARGS_AVAILABLE, but let me know how this is useful
  with userdocker!)
- ALLOWED_PUBLISH_PORTS_ALL dropped (use ARGS_AVAILABLE)

New features:
-------------

- Config files now support python variables: uid, gid, user_name, group_name and
  user_home.
- userdocker version command will include userdocker version information.
- Use of DOCKER_HOST env var will raise an ERROR.
- Users can now re-attach to their previously started containers (in case of
  connection loss for example).
- ALLOWED_PORT_MAPPINGS config var to allow configurable explicit user port
  publishing (docker run -p). Defaults to selectable container ports that are
  mappable to random host port (like in -P), but user can decide if host local
  or world accessible.
- Improved support for nvidia-docker's NV_GPU env var, which is now checked
  against admin config options:

  - User available GPU(s) configurable, including defaults in case NV_GPU isn't
    specified (NV_ALLOWED_GPUS, NV_MAX_GPU_COUNT_RESERVATION,
    NV_DEFAULT_GPU_COUNT_RESERVATION)
  - Optional exclusive GPU usage per container via the
    NV_EXCLUSIVE_CONTAINER_GPU_RESERVATION config option.
  - Optional exclusion of otherwise busy GPUs from being available to user
    containers (NV_GPU_UNAVAILABLE_ABOVE_MEMORY_USED)
  - Users can list GPUs that are used by other containers
    (userdocker ps --gpu-used)
  - Users can list free GPUs (userdocker ps --gpu-free)

Bug fixes:
----------

- Error message in case of missing executable improved.



Version 1.0.1
=============

This is a patch release.

Bug fixes:
----------

- Mitigation for nvidia-docker "--" commandline bug.



Version 1.0.0
=============

Initial release.

Features:
---------

- Similar commandline interface as ``docker ...`` called ``userdocker ...``
- Support for several docker commands / plugins (docker, nvidia-docker)
- Fine granular configurability for admins in ``/etc/userdocker/`` allows to:

   - restrict runnable images if desired (allows admin reviews)
   - restrict run to locally available images
   - restrict available mount points (or enforce them, or default mount)
   - probe mounts (to make sure nfs automounts don't make docker sad)
   - enforce non-root user in container (same uid:gid as on host)
   - enforce dropping caps
   - enforce environment vars
   - enforce docker args
   - restrict port publishing
   - explicitly white-list available args to user

- System wide config + overrides for individual groups, gids, users, uids.
- Easy extensibility for further subcommands and args.

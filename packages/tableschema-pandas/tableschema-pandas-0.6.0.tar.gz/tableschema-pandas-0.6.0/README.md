Generate and load Pandas data frames `Table
Schema <http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/>`__ descriptors.

Features
--------

-  implements ``tableschema.Storage`` interface

Getting Started
---------------

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The package use semantic versioning. It means that major versions could
include breaking changes. It's highly recommended to specify ``package``
version range in your ``setup/requirements`` file e.g.
``package>=1.0,<2.0``.

::

    $ pip install tableschema-pandas

Example
~~~~~~~

Code examples in this readme requires Python 3.3+ interpreter. You could
see even more example in
`examples <https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-pandas-py/tree/master/examples>`__
directory.

You can easily load resources from a data package as Pandas data frames
by simply using ``datapackage.push_datapackage`` function:

.. code:: python

    >>> import datapackage

    >>> data_url = 'http://data.okfn.org/data/core/country-list/datapackage.json'
    >>> storage = datapackage.push_datapackage(data_url, 'pandas')

    >>> storage.buckets
    ['data___data']

    >>> type(storage['data___data'])
    <class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>

    >>> storage['data___data'].head()
                 Name Code
    0     Afghanistan   AF
    1   Ã…land Islands   AX
    2         Albania   AL
    3         Algeria   DZ
    4  American Samoa   AS

Also it is possible to pull your existing data frame into a data
package:

.. code:: python

    >>> datapackage.pull_datapackage('/tmp/datapackage.json', 'country_list', 'pandas', tables={
    ...     'data': storage['data___data'],
    ... })
    Storage

Storage
~~~~~~~

Package implements `Tabular
Storage <https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-py#storage>`__
interface (see full documentation on the link):

|Storage|

This driver provides an additional API:

``Storage(dataframes=[])``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  ``dataframes (object[])`` - list of storage dataframes

We can get storage this way:

.. code:: python

    >>> from tableschema_pandas import Storage

    >>> storage = Storage()

Storage works as a container for Pandas data frames. You can define new
data frame inside storage using ``storage.create`` method:

.. code:: python

    >>> storage.create('data', {
    ...     'primaryKey': 'id',
    ...     'fields': [
    ...         {'name': 'id', 'type': 'integer'},
    ...         {'name': 'comment', 'type': 'string'},
    ...     ]
    ... })

    >>> storage.buckets
    ['data']

    >>> storage['data'].shape
    (0, 0)

Use ``storage.write`` to populate data frame with data:

.. code:: python

    >>> storage.write('data', [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b')])

    >>> storage['data']
    id comment
    1        a
    2        b

Also you can use
`tabulator <https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tabulator-py>`__ to
populate data frame from external data file. As you see, subsequent
writes simply appends new data on top of existing ones:

.. code:: python

    >>> import tabulator

    >>> with tabulator.Stream('data/comments.csv', headers=1) as stream:
    ...     storage.write('data', stream)

    >>> storage['data']
    id comment
    1        a
    2        b
    1     good

Contributing
------------

The project follows the `Open Knowledge International coding
standards <https://github.com/okfn/coding-standards>`__.

| Recommended way to get started is to create and activate a project
virtual environment.
| To install package and development dependencies into active
environment:

::

    $ make install

To run tests with linting and coverage:

.. code:: bash

    $ make test

| For linting ``pylama`` configured in ``pylama.ini`` is used. On this
stage it's already
| installed into your environment and could be used separately with more
fine-grained control
| as described in documentation -
https://pylama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

For example to sort results by error type:

.. code:: bash

    $ pylama --sort <path>

| For testing ``tox`` configured in ``tox.ini`` is used.
| It's already installed into your environment and could be used
separately with more fine-grained control as described in documentation
- https://testrun.org/tox/latest/.

| For example to check subset of tests against Python 2 environment with
increased verbosity.
| All positional arguments and options after ``--`` will be passed to
``py.test``:

.. code:: bash

    tox -e py27 -- -v tests/<path>

| Under the hood ``tox`` uses ``pytest`` configured in ``pytest.ini``,
``coverage``
| and ``mock`` packages. This packages are available only in tox
envionments.

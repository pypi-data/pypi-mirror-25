PyQ - Python for kdb+
=====================

|Documentation Status| |PyPI Version|

PyQ_ brings the `Python programming language`_ to the `kdb+ database`_.  It
allows developers to seamlessly integrate Python and q codes in one
application.  This is achieved by bringing the Python and q interpreters in
the same process so that codes written in either of the languages operate on
the same data.  In PyQ, Python and q objects live in the same memory space
and share the same data.

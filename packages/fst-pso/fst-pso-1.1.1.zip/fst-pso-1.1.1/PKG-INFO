Description: =====================
        Fuzzy Self-Tuning PSO
        =====================
        
        *Fuzzy Self-Tuning PSO* (FST-PSO) is a swarm intelligence global optimization method [1]
        based on Particle Swarm Optimization [2].
        
        FST-PSO is settings-free version of PSO which exploits fuzzy logic to dynamically assign the functioning parameters to each particle in the swarm. Specifically, during each generation, FST-PSO is determines the optimal choice for the cognitive factor, the social factor, the inertia value, the minimum velocity, and the maximum velocity. FST-PSO also uses an heuristics to choose the swarm size. 
        
        FST-PSO is designed for real-valued multi-dimensional minimization problems.
        
        In order to use FST-PSO, the programmer must implement:
        
        * a custom fitness function;
        
        * the number of dimensions of the problem;
        
        * the boundaries of the search space for each dimension.
        
        The programmer can also specify the maximum number of fitness evaluations. FST-PSO returns the best fitting solution along with its fitness value.
        
        
        
        Example
        =======
        FST-PSO can be used as follows:
        
        from fstpso import FuzzyPSO	
        
        def example_fitness( particle ):
        	return sum(map(lambda x: x**2, particle))
        
        if __name__ == '__main__':
        	
        	dims = 10
        	FP = FuzzyPSO( D=dims )
        	FP.set_fitness(example_fitness)
        	FP.set_search_space( [[-10, 10]]*dims )	
        	result =  FP.solve_with_fstpso(max_iter=100)
        	print "Best solution:", result[0]
        	print "Whose fitness is:", result[1]

def process_kwargs(listoftuples, kwargs, pass_through=False, as_attr=False):
    '''This function allows dynamically processed (*i.e.* function definitions with `**kwargs`) kwargs (keyword arguments) to be dealt with in a fashion more like standard kwargs.
    The defaults set in `listoftuples` are used to process `kwargs`, which are then returned as a set of values (that are set to defaults as needed).

    Note that having `kwargs` as an explicit argument avoids errors where the user forgets to pass the `kwargs`.
    
    Parameters
    ==========
    kwargs : **dictionary

        The keyword arguments that you want to process.

    listoftuples : list of tuple pairs

        Tuple pairs, consisting of ``('param_name',param_value)``, that give the default values for the various parameters.

    pass_through : bool

        Defaults to False.  If it's true, then it's OK not to process all the kwargs here.
        In that case, the used kwargs are popped out of the dictionary, and you are expected to pass the unprocessed values (in the dictionary after the call) on to subsequent processing.
        Importantly, you should *always* end with a `pass_through`=`False` call of this function, or by passing **kwargs to a standard function in the standard way.
        Otherwise it's possible for the user to pass kwargs that are never processed!
    as_attr : bool, object

        Defaults to False. If not False, it must be an object whose attributes are set to the value of the respective kwargs.

    return : tuple

        It's expected that the output is assigned to variables with the **exact same** names as the string in the first half of the tuples, in the **exact same** order.
        These parameters will then be set to the appropriate values.

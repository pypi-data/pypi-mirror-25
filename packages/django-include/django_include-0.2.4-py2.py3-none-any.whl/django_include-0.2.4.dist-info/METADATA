ORM extensions for performance-conscious perfectionists.

Django-include provides ``select_related`` functionality for Many-to-X relations.


Requirements
============

Python 2.7 or 3.5+, Django 1.9+, and any SQL server with support for JSON aggregations.

Currently tested against Postgres 9.6. May work with SQLite with the JSON1 extension.


Installation
============

::

  pip install django-include

Usage
=====

Add `include` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.

Attach ``IncludeManager`` to a model:

.. code-block:: python

  from include import IncludeManager

  class BlogPost(models.Model):
      objects = IncludeManager()

Subclass `IncludeQuerySet`:

.. code-block:: python

  from include import IncludeQuerySet

  class CustomQuerySet(IncludeQuerySet):
      def custom_method(self):
          pass

  class BlogPost(models.Model):
      objects = CustomQuerySet.as_manager()


What/Why?
=========

Consider the following:

Given the following models.

.. code-block:: python

  class Email(Model):
      name = CharField()
      user = ForeignKey('User')


  class User(Model):
      emails = ...


  class Contributor(Model):
      role = CharField()
      user = ForeignKey('User')
      project = ForeignKey('Project')

  class Project(Model):
      contributors = ...

There is an endpoint that returns all the users that contributed to a project, their roles, and their email addresses.

If this endpoint were to be implemented using just Django's ORM, it would end up looking something like this:

.. code-block:: python

    project = Project.objects.get(pk=id)  # 1 Query
    for contributor in project.contributors.select_related('users'):  # 1 Query
        [x for x in contributor.user.emails.all()]  # N * M Queries!
        # Some serialization code

At first this solution seems fine, but what happens when a project has an entire college of people, each with a couple email addresses?
Now, there are certainly other tricks that could be done here to reduce the number of queries and runtime.
For instance, dropping down into raw SQL with a couple joins and/or subselects.

Or you could just use `.include`, do a single query, and not have to explain all the *neat* things you did.

.. code-block:: python

    project = Project.objects.include('contributors__user__emails')  # 1 Query
    for contributor in project.contributors.all():  # Already loaded
        [x for x in contributor.user.emails.all()]  # Already loaded
        # Some serialization code

How?
====

Django Include abuses JSON aggregations and Django's `extra`/`annotate` functions to embed related data.

Description: helga-mimic
        ===========
        
        Builds markov chains of users and channels. Will produce an example
        line on demand. commands will allow for rebuilding the markov chain
        for a channel or user.
        
        Requires the .. _helga-oral-history: https://github.com/bigjust/helga-oral-history
        
        We've also integrated cobe (https://github.com/pteichman/cobe) which
        is the latest iteration of MegaHAL, a conversational brain that uses
        markov chains for learning and can respond to statements, using the
        message as a seed.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        We can mimic the current channel::
        
          <bigjust> !mimic
          <helga> if not, why are we counting from dusk till dawn?
        
        or a specific user::
        
          <bigjust> !mimic bigjust
          <helga> I'm a dork, haha
        
        or a list of users::
        
          <bigjust> !mimic bigjust justin
          <helga> I thought W was the 25th anniversary of the GOP
        
        replace brain by relearning whats in the db (aka how we update
        currently)::
        
          <bigjust> !mimic build
          <helga> I learned some stuff!
        
        teach helga a new personality::
        
           <bigjust> !mimic load <key> <url>
           <helga> <key> loaded.
           <bigjust> !mimic <key>
           <helga> wuba dub dub!

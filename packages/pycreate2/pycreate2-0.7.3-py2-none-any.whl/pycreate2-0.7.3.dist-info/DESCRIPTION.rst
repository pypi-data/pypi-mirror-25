    :target:  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycreate2

A python library for controlling the `iRobot Create 2 <http://www.irobot.com/About-iRobot/STEM/Create-2.aspx>`_.

Install
------------

pip
~~~~~

The recommended way to install this library is::

	pip install pycreate2

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to develop and submit git-pulls, you can do::

	git clone https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2
	cd pycreate2
	pip install -e .

Unit Testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

	nosetests -v -w tests test.py
	python3 -m nose -v -w tests test.py

Use
-------------

There are multiple ways to command the Create to move, here are some examples:

.. code-block:: python

	from  pycreate2 import Create2
	import time

	# Create a Create2.
	bot = Create2()

	# Start the Create 2
	bot.start()

	# Put the Create2 into 'safe' mode so we can drive it
	# This will still provide some protection
	bot.safe()

	# You are responsible for handling issues, no protection/safety in
	# this mode ... becareful
	bot.full()

	# directly set the motor speeds ... easier if using a joystick
	bot.drive_direct(100, 100)

	# turn an angle [degrees] at a speed: 45 deg, 100 mm/sec
	bot.turn_angle(45, 100)

	# drive straight for a distance: 5 meters, reverse 100 mm/sec
	drive_distance(5, -100)

	# Tell the Create2 to drive straight forward at a speed of 100 mm/s
	bot.drive_straight(100)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Tell the Create2 to drive straight backward at a speed of 100 mm/s
	bot.drive_straight(-100)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(100, 0)
	time.sleep(2)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(-100, 0)
	time.sleep(4)

	# Turn in place
	bot.drive_turn(100, 0)
	time.sleep(2)

	# use the simpler drive direct
	bot.drive_direct(200,-200)  # inputs for motors are +/- 500 max
	time.sleep(2)

	# Stop the bot
	bot.drive_stop()

	# query some sensors
	sensors = bot.get_sensors()  # returns all data
	print(sensors.light_bumper_left)

	# Close the connection
	# bot.close()

More examples are found in the `examples folder <https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2/tree/master/examples>`_.

Documents

Additional notes and documents are in the `docs folder <https://github.com/walchko/pycreate2/tree/master/docs/Markdown>`_.

Modes
~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walchko/pycreate2/master/pics/create_modes.png
	:align: center

The different modes (OFF, PASSIVE, SAFE, and FULL) can be switched between by calling different
commands.

- **OFF:** The robot is off and can charge, it will accept no commands
- **PASSIVE:** The robot is in standbye and can charge. It will send sensor packets, but will not move
- **SAFE:** The robot will not charge, but you full control over it with a few exceptions. If the cliff sensors or wheel drop sensors are triggered, the robot goes back to PASSIVE mode.
- **FULL:** The robot will not charge and you have full control. You are responsible to handle any response due to cliff, wheel drop or any other sensors.

Sensor Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sensor data is returned as a ``namedtuple`` from ``collections``. The information can be
accessed as either::

	sensors = bot.get_sensors()
	sensors.wall == sensors[1]  # True

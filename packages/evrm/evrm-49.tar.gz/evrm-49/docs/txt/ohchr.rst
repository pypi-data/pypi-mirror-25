Submitting  the communication as:

(a) Victim of the violation or violations set forth below [x]

II. Information concerning the alleged  victim(s) (if other than author):

III. State concerned/articles violated/domestic remedies

Name of the State party (country) to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment against which  the communication is directed:

Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Articles of the Convention against Torture allegedly violated:

There is proof that medicine used to treat people with mental disabilities are poisson:

    haloperiodol (haldol) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.000.142
    clozapine (leponex) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.024.831
    olanzapine (zyprexa) - https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.125.320
    aripriprazole (abilify) https://echa.europa.eu/substance-information/-/substanceinfo/100.112.532


Article 1.

"It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions."

This is about care to patient without the forced, by law applicable, treatement of a schizophrenic. 
I received treatement out of free will, not forced upon, so this is not arisen from a lawful sanction.


Article 4.

A doctor giving his patient poisson is not punishable here in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The argument heared is that is is not the intent of the doctor to hurt it's
patient. I think that the doctors are aware that the "medicine" prescribed
are poison and that the torture is done intentionally (zekerheidsbewustzijn
als opzet). The argument that treatement is for your good and that the
damage/hurt is not intentionally is used to block access to the Judge.

It should be, but it is impossible to get the doctor in front of a Judge if he uses poison.


Article 6.

A doctor is not getting prosecuted if he administers, or writes a prescription, of a medicine that is actually a poison.

Article 10.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands is not informing it's employees, nor it's inhabitants about the toxic nature of the medicine used in treatement of schizofrenics.

Article 11.

Treatement of schizofrenics with antipsychotics is not seen as torture. The antipsychotics are seen as medicine not as a poison.
Because it is a poison it should be seen as torture.


Article 12.

No criminal investigation takes place if a schizofrenic patient gets administered poison.

Article 13.

The Kingdom of the Netherlands does not prosecute doctors who use poison in their treatement.

Article 14.

Since the fact that the poisonous nature of these medicine are not acknowledged no redress or compensation is given.

Article 16.

Treatement with poison is torture.


Steps taken by or on behalf of the alleged victim(s) to exhaust domestic remedies-recourse to the courts or other public authorities, when and with what results (if possible, enclose copies of all relevant judicial or administrative decisions):

Was not able to have to the police my declaration of misuse of my partner with medicine that turned out the be toxic get accepted. 

After complaining to the Queen of the Kingdom of the Netherlands it was possible to get a declaration to the court, but it was declared not applicable.

The courts are not accessible for schizofrenic patients.

If domestic remedies have not been exhausted, explain why:

not applicable.


IV. Other international  procedures

Has the same matter been submitted for examination under another procedure of international investigation or settlement (e.g. the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the European Commission on Human Rights)? 
If so, when and with what results?

I did write a complaint to the European Commission on Human Rights. Result was "niet-ontvankelijk".

I, as a schizofrenic patient, have no means to defend my rights.

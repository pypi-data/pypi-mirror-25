Description: # Simple Affiliate System for Django
        
        
        This is a very simple library that can be used to provide affiliate links in your django application.
        It is intentionally very lightweight, allowing your application to do whatever it wants with the data.
        
        The project is very loosely inspired by the [django-affiliate](https://github.com/st4lk/django-affiliate) library,
        though seeks to provide a lighter-weight way to provide the core set of functionality without requiring the
        use of any additional data models.
        
        If you are looking for a more heavyweight/comprehensive solution you may be better off with
        [django-affiliate](https://github.com/st4lk/django-affiliate).
        
        ## How it Works
        
        
        You give a code to each partner you want to send links to your application.
        They choose a link that includes their code in an `aid` parameter in the URL. E.g.
        
        `http://example.com/?aid=12345`
        
        This code is saved in the django session using a middleware, which also adds the id to the request
        as `request.affiliate_id` (note: the ID will also be added if there was no URL param but an id was found
        already in the session).
        
        Then you can use whatever custom processing logic you want on the `request.affiliate_id` throughout the
        rest of your code.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - python (only tested on 3.5 but should work in 2.7)
        - django (only tested in 1.11 but might work with older versions)
        
        
        ## Quick start
        
        1. Install this package to your python distribution
        
        `pip install django-affiliate`
        
        2. Add `'simple_affiliate.middleware.affiliate_middleware'` to `MIDDLEWARE`:
        
        ```python
        MIDDLEWARE = (
            # ...
            'simple_affiliate.middleware.affiliate_middleware',
        )
        ```
        
        3. Reward / track affiliate
        
        ```python
        if request.affiliate_id and made_some_cash(request):
            pay_affiliate_by_id(request.affiliate_id, dollar_value(request)
        ```
        
        ## Project Todos
        
          - [] Add / document expiration timeout functionality
          - [] Add tests

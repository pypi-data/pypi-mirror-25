Introduction
------------

Read the following for instructions on how to upgrade between versions

Please note that only upgrade paths for consecutive versions have been tested.
Upgrade from 0.1 to 0.3 for example may or may not work.

Maintenance
-----------

It is possible to use a maintenace page instead of stopping the
application server in case you want to. A sample maintenance page is
provided in /static/maintenance.html but feel free to create your own.

Depending on your application server, different configuration steps will
be required. All in all, stopping all requests to the application and
presenting your maintenance page should be enough. Sample configuration
stanzas are provided below

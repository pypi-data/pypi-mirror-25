        openpyn : A wrapper around openvpn
        ===============
        
        A python3 script to easily connect to and switch between, **OpenVPN servers hosted by NordVPN**.
        Quickly Connect to the **least busy** servers (using current data from Nordvpn's website) with **lowest latency** from you.
        Find servers in a **specific country** or even a **city**. It **Tunnels DNS traffic** through the VPN which normally
        (when using OpenVPN with NordVPN) goes through your ISP's DNS (still unencrypted, even if you use a thirdparty)
        and completely compromises Privacy!
        
        Features
        --------
        - Automatically connect to least busy, low latency servers in a given country.
        - Find and connect to servers in a specific city or state. (New!)
        - Uses NordVPN's DNS servers and tunnels DNS queries through the VPN Tunnel.
        - Use Iptable rules to prevent leakage if tunnel breaks (Experimental).
        - Quickly Connect to any specific server. i.e au10 or us20.
        - Downloads and Updates (modifications) the latest config files from NordVPN.
        - Option to run the script in background (openvpn daemon mode).
        - Options to finetune server selection based on "Server Load" or "Ping Latency".
        - Excludes the servers that don't support OpenVPN (TCP or UDP depending upon which one you are trying to use).
        - Finds and displays nord vpn servers (with extra info) in a given country.
        - Now list and connect to servers with "Peer To Peer" --p2p, "Dedicated IP" --dedicated, "Tor Over VPN" --tor, \
        "Double VPN" --double, "Anti DDos" --anti-ddos support.

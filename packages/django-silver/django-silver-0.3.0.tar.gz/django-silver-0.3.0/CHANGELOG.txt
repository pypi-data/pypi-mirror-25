=== 0.3.0 (2017-09-28) ===
Some of these changes that were considered to be possibly breaking were marked with (WARNING).
- Celery and Redis are no longer a requirement, as the django commands and celery tasks
that are supposed to be run periodically now have equivalents in both versions.
Using celery tasks is still the recommended way to go.
- Refactored a fair part of the logic responsible for automatic billing documents generation.
This change might affect the way in which trial periods are handled, but it was necessary as the
old code was really hard to maintain and even understand in some places.
To allow configuring the billing cycles, the following fields were added to the Provider and Plan models,
with the Plan ones being optional and having priority over the Provider ones: (WARNING)
  - `generate_documents_on_trial_end`
  - `separate_cycles_during_trial`
  - `prebill_plan`
- BillingLog now has two additional date fields (`plan_billed_up_to` and `metered_features_billed_up_to`)
that better describe what was already billed. An attempt to populate the existing Billing Logs with these
fields was made through a migration, but it's possible that certain billing cycles involving trial periods
might be off. Make sure to double check the next wave of automatically generated documents. (WARNING)
- A clear example of behavior change is that generating a canceled subscription's invoice will no longer wait
for the next months invoices to be generated even if the customer has consolidated billing.

=== 0.2.16 (2017-08-23) ===
Version 0.2.15 was published with errors.
- Added a total field to BillingLog, to store the amount a subscription has been billed with.
- Fixed API pagination headers.

=== 0.2.12 (2017-07-24) ===
Versions 0.2.9 to 0.2.11 were published with errors.
- Silver now supports both Django 1.8 and 1.11.
- Added an Admin action that allows marking PDFs for generation.
- Transactions and Payment Methods are now ordered by default descendingly by id.

=== 0.2.8 (2017-07-17) ===
Some of these changes are considered to be breaking and were marked with (BREAKING)
- The PDFs for Invoices and Proformas are now generated asynchronously using Celery tasks. Redis is required for locking. (BREAKING)
- PDFs now have their own model, therefore a migration has been created, which unfortunately fails to migrate the file url. (BREAKING)
A way to fix this would be to regenerate and re-upload the PDFs. Another way that should work would be to set the PDF.pdf_file.name value from the old Invoice.pdf_file.name.

=== 0.2.7 (2017-02-08) ===
- Added a setting that allows automatically creating transaction when a payment method is verified.

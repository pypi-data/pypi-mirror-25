Junebug is an open-source server application providing SMS and USSD
gateway connectivity for integrators, operators and application
developers.

integrations.

Junebug is a system for managing text messaging transports via a
RESTful HTTP interface that supports:

* Creating, introspecting, updating and deleting transports
* Sending and receiving text messages
* Receiving status updates on text messages sent
* Monitoring transport health and performance
* Retrieving recent transport logs for debugging transport issues.

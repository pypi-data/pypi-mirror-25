        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The fsmonitor module provides live filesystem monitoring. It can be used to monitor for
        events such as file creation, deletion, modification and so on::
        
            from fsmonitor import FSMonitor
        
        The FSMonitor class manages filesystem watches and is used to receive events. Call the
        add_dir_watch() method to add a directory watch to the monitor::
        
            m = FSMonitor()
            watch = m.add_dir_watch("/dir/to/watch")
        
        Once a watch has been added, you can call read_events() to read a list of filesystem
        events. This is a blocking call and in some cases it might return an empty list, so it
        needs to be re-called repeatedly to get more events::
        
            while True:
                for evt in m.read_events():
                    print evt.action_name, evt.name
        
        The FSMonitorThread class can be used to receive events asynchronously with a callback.
        The callback will be called from another thread so it is responsible for thread-safety.
        If a callback is not specified, the thread will collect events in a list which can be
        read by calling read_events().

ResoFit
=======

Abstract
~~~~~~~~

Here we present an open-source Python library which focuses on
simulating the neutron resonance signal for neutron imaging
measurements. In this package, by defining the sample information such
as density, thickness in the neutron path and isotopic ratios of the
elemental composition of the material, one can plot of expected
resonance peaks for a selected neutron energy range. Various sample
types such as layers of single elements (Ag, Co, etc. in solid form),
chemical compounds (UO\ :sub:`2`, Gd\ :sub:`2`\O\ :sub:`3`, etc.), or even multiple layers of both
types. Major plotting features include display of the
transmission/attenuation in wavelength/energy/time scale, show/hide
elemental and isotopic contributions in the total resonance signal.

The energy dependent cross-section data used in this library are from
`National Nuclear Data Center <http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/>`__, a published
online database. `Evaluated Nuclear Data File
(ENDF/B) <http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor/endf00.jsp>`__ [1] is currently
supported and more evaluated databases will be added in future.

Python packages used are: SciPy [2], NumPy [3], Matplotlib [4], Pandas
[5] and Periodictable [6].

Statement of need
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Neutron imaging is a powerful tool to characterize material
non-destructively. And based on the unique resonance features, it is
feasible to identify elements and/or isotopes which resonance with
incident neutrons. However, a dedicated tool for resonance imaging is
missing, and **ResoFit** we presented here could fill this gap.

Installation instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install **ResoFit** by typing the following command in Terminal:

``pip install ResoFit``

or by typing the following command under downloaded directory in
Terminal:

``python setup.py``

Example usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example of usage is presented in ``tutorial.ipynb`` under ``/notebooks``
directory.

Calculation algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The neutron transmission calculation algorithm of neutron transmission
*T*\ (*E*), is base on Beer-lambert law [7]-[9]:

    :alt: Beer-lambert law 1

N\ :sub:`i` : number of atoms per unit volume of element *i*,

d\ :sub:`i` : effective thickness along the neutron path of element *i*,

σ\ :sub:`ij` (E) : energy-dependent neutron total cross-section for the isotope *j* of element *i*,

A\ :sub:`ij` : abundance for the isotope *j* of element *i*.

For solid materials the number of atoms per unit volume can be
calculated from:

N\ :sub:`A` : Avogadro’s number,

C\ :sub:`i` : molar concentration of element *i*,

ρ\ :sub:`i` : density of the element *i*,

m\ :sub:`ij` : atomic mass values for the isotope *j* of element *i*.

# NOTE: We install all TissueMAPS python packages into the home folder because
# we export this folder on the cluster. This is convenient, because packages
# can then be updated on the frontend only and these changes become immediatly
# effective on all compute nodes.

# This shouldn't be necessary, but some packages don't build correctly when
# cython and numpy are not already installed.

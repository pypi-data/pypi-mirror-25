Description: 
        Most fault tolerant protocols (including RAFT, PBFT, Zyzzyva, Q/U)
        don't guarantee good performance when there are Byzantine faults. Even
        the so-called "robust" BFT protocols (like UpRight, RBFT, Prime,
        Spinning, and Stellar) have various hard-coded timeout parameters, and
        can only guarantee performance when the network behaves approximately as
        expected - hence they are best suited to well-controlled settings like
        corporate data centers.
        
        HoneyBadgerBFT is fault tolerance for the wild wild wide-area-network.
        HoneyBadger nodes can even stay hidden behind anonymizing relays like
        Tor, and the purely-asynchronous protocol will make progress at whatever
        rate the network supports.

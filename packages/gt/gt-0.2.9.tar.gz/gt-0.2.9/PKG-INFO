Description: Goals
        =====
        
        To provide a simple tool for quickly creating private git repos 'in the
        cloud' wherever that may be.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Requires python 3.
        
        ``pip3 install gt`` should do the trick, or else
        ``python setup.py install`` from source.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Create **~/.gtrc** and populate it with sections of the following form
        
        ::
        
            [<source name>]
            type=<git source>
            <param1>=<val1>
            <param2>=<val2>
        
        where ``<git source>`` indicates the source type.
        
        Supported sources at the time of writing include: - gitlab (the service)
        - ssh (An ssh-able Unix box containing a directory full of repos)
        
        Examples
        ========
        
        ~/.gtrc
        -------
        
        ::
        
            [ s1 ]
            type=ssh
            host=dionysus
            user=rvaiya
            project_dir=/storage/projects
        
            [ gl ]
            type=gitlab
            api_token=a734d981ddda8
        
        CLI Usage
        ---------
        
        ::
        
            # gt -l
        
            s1/project1
            s1/project2
            gl/projecta
            gl/projectb
        
            # gt -c s1/project3
        
            Successfully created s1/project3
            git remote add origin ssh://rvaiya@dionysus:/storage/projects/project3
        
            # gt -d gl/projecta
        
            Successfully deleted gl/projecta
            
            # gt --clone gl/projecta
            
            Cloning into 'projecta'...
            remote: Counting objects: 20, done.
            remote: Compressing objects: 100% (17/17), done.
            remote: Total 20 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
            Receiving objects: 100% (20/20), 22.00 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
            Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), done.
            Checking connectivity... done.
        
        
        Bugs/Limitations
        ================
        
        The tool is designed to handle as many git sources as possible and so
        only supports primitive operations (i.e add/remove/delete). Since it is
        primarily intended for personal use it does not support sophisticated
        project or permission management features which are commonly found on
        proprietary collaboration platforms like github.
        
        There will be bugs.
        
        Extensibility
        =============
        
        Adding a source should be as simple as creating a python file in
        gt/sources and defining a class with the following methods:
        
        -  list()
        -  delete(name)
        -  create(name)
        
        The class name serves as the source type and its constructor's parameter
        names are drawn from the relevant section of the config file when
        instantiating the object.
        
        It is worth noting that the project began life as a bash script and was
        partly rewritten as an exercise in python by the author. As such things
        may not be optimally 'pythonic' :). If you bother to read the code and
        invariably feel the need to abuse the person who wrote it, know that
        such sentiments will be happily received at r.vaiya@gmail.com.

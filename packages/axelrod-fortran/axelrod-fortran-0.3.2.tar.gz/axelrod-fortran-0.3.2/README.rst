Installation
============

To use this library the original Fortran code must be compiled:
https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/TourExec.

::

    pip install axelrod-fortran


Usage
=====

Running a match:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import axelrod_fortran as axlf
   >>> import axelrod as axl
   >>> p1 = axlf.Player('k31r')
   >>> p2 = axlf.Player('k33r')
   >>> match = axl.Match((p1, p2), turns=5)
   >>> match.play()
   [(C, C), (C, C), (C, D), (C, D), (C, C)]

Running an instance of Axelrod's second tournament:

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import axelrod_fortran as axlf
   >>> import axelrod as axl
   >>> players = [axlf.Player(name) for name in axlf.second_tournament_strategies]
   >>> print(len(players), "players")
   63 players
   >>> tournament = axl.Tournament(players, repetitions=1,
   ...                             turns=63, match_attributes={"length": -1})
   >>> results = tournament.play()
   >>> results.write_summary('summary.csv')
   >>> plot = axl.Plot(results)
   >>> plot.save_all_plots("second_tournament")

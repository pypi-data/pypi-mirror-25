Current state:

* Have item finding logic split between Container methods and ItemSearch class
* Got to rewriting cmd_drop with new ItemSearch
* Problems with ItemSearch:
    * Take and drop need to find in both container and user for context, but
      can only accept one.
    * Really messy right now
    * single/plural data is lost in ItemSearch:
        `drop cat` is different to `drop cats`
* Solution:
    * Refactor ItemSearch into Container and ItemActionHandler
    * This will make it easier for action handlers to override things as they need
        * which containers to search
        * different error handling logic
        * different deduping logic
    * Just make sure it's not going to be a pita.

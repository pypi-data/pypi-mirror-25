QuiCalc by Abhishta
============

Welcome and Thank You for using Quick Calculator. Please do contribute and give feedbacks on this little program and hopes it developes better over time.

The goal here is to insert a quite powerful calculator in the Terminal so you can do math on the fly and back again. We use simple built-in python modules / libraries that may fit your needs. But feel free to put your own modules inside by tweaking the import section of the 'calc.py'.

Please do not redistribute this program. Although it is free to use, make sure to give credit where credit is done.

Have fun and hope to make everything easier.

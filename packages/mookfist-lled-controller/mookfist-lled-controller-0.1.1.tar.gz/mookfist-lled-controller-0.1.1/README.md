# Mookfist LimitlessLED Controller v0.1.1

Intended as a simple wrapper around the LimitlessLED wifi protocol written in python.

Supports wifi bridge versions 4, 5, and 6.

Currently white temperature support is not implemented.

There are no plans to implement the "party mode" features of the Limitless LED protocol. But I am not against accepting a pull request for them.

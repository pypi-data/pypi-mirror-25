        How it works
        ------------
        
        Contactfolder
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        This is a dexterity contenttype and acts as a container for contacts to be listed.
        
        After installing the ``ftw.contacts`` package you can add a ``Contactfolder`` to your plonesite.
        
        The ``Contactfolder`` provides a nice overview of all available contacts.
        By default, the first 20 contacts will be shown and you can load more contacts by clicking on the
        ``Load more`` button at the end of the list.
        
        The alphabetical filter allows the user to quickly find a contact. Furthermore contacts can be found by using the search field.
        
        All the requests are asynchron and works also with a big amount of contacts
        
        Contact
        ~~~~~~~
        
        This is a dexterity contenttype addable in a ``Contactfolder``.
        
        A ``Contact`` lists all available attributes on the contact.
        
        You have also the possiblity to show the contacts location on a map.
        
        In addition you can download the kml-representation or the vCard-representation of the contact.
        
        ftw.simplelayout integration
        ----------------------------
        
        This is an addon for `ftw.simplelayout`_. Please make sure you
        already installed ``ftw.simplelayout`` on your plone site before installing this addon.
        
        Add the simplelayout extra to your egg:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
          [instance]
          eggs += ftw.contacts [simplelayout]
        
        Run buildout and install the ``ftw.contacts.simplelayout:default`` profile
        
        You'll get a new contenttype ``MemberBlock`` which is available in a contentpage.
        
        If you don't know `ftw.simplelayout`_, please read https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.simplelayout
        
        MemberBlock
        ~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The memberblock connects the a Contact with a simplelayout page.
        You just have do define the Contact attributes once an you can reuse them trough
        the memberblock
        
        
        ftw.geo integration
        -------------------
        
        Add the geo extra to your egg:
        
        .. code:: ini
        
          [instance]
          eggs += ftw.contacts [geo]
        
        Run buildout and install the ``ftw.contacts.geo:default`` profile
        
        After installing the geo-extra, you'll see a maplayer on each contact-type
        if you entered a valid address.
        
        If you don't know `ftw.geo`_, please read https://github.com/4teamwork/ftw.geo

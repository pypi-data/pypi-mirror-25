        ==========
        
        ``run_lambda`` is a Python package for running Python
        `AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ functions locally. It offers a
        Python module for automated testing of Lambda functions, as well as a
        command-line interface for ad-hoc local invocations.
        
        Doesn't something like this already exist?
        ------------------------------------------
        
        Not exactly. There are other programs for locally running Python Lambda
        functions. However, all of the other utilities (that I know of) only provide
        a command-line tool. A command-line tool is great for quick manual invocations.
        However, if you want to create robust, automated tests for your Lambda functions,
        a Python module that you can import and call is more appropriate.
        ``run_lambda`` is unique because it offers both a simple command-line tool for
        manual invocations, and an importable Python module for automated tests.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        ``run_lambda`` supports
        
        - An interface for examining the result (return value, exception, timeout) of
          a function call
        - A full implementation of AWS Context objects
        - Function calls with or without a timeout
        - Resource usage profiling (memory and run-time)
        - Convenient mocking of objects and services inside Lambda functions
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The easiest way to install is via ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install run_lambda

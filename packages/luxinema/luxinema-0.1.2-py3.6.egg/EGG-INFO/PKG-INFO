        ========
        
        -----
        
        Luxinema is a small tool that grabs the movie schedule information
        from the LUX cinema in Nijmegen and displays it together with IMDB Ratings.
        It is being developed more as a personal learning experience then for
        robustness.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        luxinema supports python 3.5 and 3.6.
        Either clone the project, or install it with:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            $ pip install git+https://github.com/dangom/luxinema.git
        
        Usage
        -------
        After installation, running :code:`luxinema` will display the LUX schedule for the current day.
        That is currently the only functionality implemented. When running for the first time,
        the program may take about 15 seconds to show results, because it has to create a cache
        and request the IMDB information for each movie.
        
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        - Create a usable CLI Tool.
        - Query for specific movie.
        - Query for date range, instead of single day.
        - Add support for proper caching (redis? Interesting, but easier and simpler with requests_cache).
        - Twilio to query infos per SMS.

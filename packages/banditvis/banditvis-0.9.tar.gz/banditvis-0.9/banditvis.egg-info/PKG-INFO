Description: Intro
        =====
        
        This Bandit Visualization module provides an easy-to-use library for
        implementing and visualizing various Bandit algorithms and environments
        in machine learning. If you are looking for the following, this library
        is not for you:
        
        -  You want something fast and efficient
        -  You want a tool to run very large simulations
        
        It is good to use if you want to
        
        -  Visualize your algorithms in various ways
        -  Quickly make nice looking graphs
        -  Have the support of a super-straightforward minilanguage
        -  Have a command-line tool and a module you can import
        
        The library is implemented in python3. This library is dependent also on
        the following modules, and you must have them installed to run this:
        
        -  pyyaml (text parsing)
        -  numpy (math)
        -  scipy (stats)
        -  matplotlib (creating graphs)
        
        Run files using
        
        ::
        
            banditvis path/to/your/file.txt
        
        Get syntax help with
        
        ::
        
            banditvis -h

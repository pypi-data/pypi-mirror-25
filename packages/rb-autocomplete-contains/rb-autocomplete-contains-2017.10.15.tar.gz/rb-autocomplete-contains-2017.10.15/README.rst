AutoComplete Contains
=====================

rb-autocomplete-contains is an `extension
<https://www.reviewboard.org/docs/manual/3.0/extending/>`_ for `Review
Board <https://www.reviewboard.org/>`_ 3.0+ that enhances the auto
complete mode of the review groups field in a review request.

Instead of just suggesting groups that begin with the text entered, it
will list all groups that contain the entered text. This is specially
useful when you have many groups that share a common prefix.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install rb-autocomplete-contains

datauri
=======

``datauri`` is a small Python library implementing the ``data:`` uri
scheme defined in RFC2397_. The generic format is::

  data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>

.. _RFC2397: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2397


Installation
============

Install ``datauri`` from PyPI using::

  pip install datauri

Note: this library is for Python 3 only.


Usage
=====

::

  >>> import datauri

To parse a string containing a ``data:`` uri, use ``parse()``::

  >>> parsed = datauri.parse('data:text/plain,A%20brief%20note')

This returns a parse result::

  >>> parsed.media_type
  'text/plain'
  >>> parsed.data
  b'A brief note'
  >>> parsed.uri
  'data:text/plain,A%20brief%20note'

This is a simple container class with a few attributes:

* The ``media_type`` attribute is a string (``str``) or ``None`` in
  case it was absent. Any (optional) embedded text encoding
  specifications are not processed in any way; it is up to the
  application to deal with that.

* The ``data`` attribute is a byte string (``bytes``) with the decoded
  data. URL encoding and base64 is handled transparently.

* For convenience, the ``uri`` attribute contains the input uri.

Parsed URIs compare equal if their media type and data are the same.
Instances are hashable, so they can be used as dictionary keys.

Parsing failures will raise a ``DataURIError``::

  >>> datauri.parse('invalid')
  Traceback (most recent call last):
  …
  datauri.DataURIError: invalid data uri

The ``DataURIError`` subclasses the built-in ``ValueError``,
so this will work as expected::

  try:
      datauri.parse('invalid')
  except ValueError:
      pass

In addition to parsing a string, this library can also discover (and
directly parse) any ``data:`` URIs found in a larger string::

  s = 'long string with data:text/plain,A%20brief%20note and more'
  for parsed in datauri.discover(s):
      print(s)

EGTAOnline Api
==============

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/egtaonline-api/badge/?version=latest)](http://egtaonline-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

Command line and python access to egtaonline.


Install
-------

```
pip install egtaonlineapi
```


Usage
-----

- The command line entry point is `eo`. `eo --help` will list all the options
  available.
- The python entry point is `egtaonline.api`. This has slightly more
  functionality than the command line api.


Cookbook
--------

These are useful scripts that illustrate what can be done with the api.

- Monitor a scheduler and report when it's done:

  ```
  while ! eo sched <sched-id> -r | jq -e '.scheduling_requirements | map(.current_count >= .requirement) | all' > /dev/null; do sleep <sleep-interval>; done; <notify-script>
  ```

  This will poll `<sched-id>` every `<sleep-interval>` seconds and run `<notify-script>` when the scheduler is done.

        ====================
        
        SNPknock is a simple Python package for creating knockoff copies of variables 
        distributed as discrete Markov chains or hidden Markov models. SNPknock also 
        includes specific support for knockoff copies of genotype data, through a 
        user-friendly interface to the imputation software `fastPhase`.

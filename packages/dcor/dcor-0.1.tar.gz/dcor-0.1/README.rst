dcor: distance correlation and distance covariance in Python.

Distance covariance and distance correlation are
dependency measures between random vectors introduced in [SRB07]_.

This package offers functions for calculating several statistics
related with distance covariance and distance correlation, including
biased and unbiased estimators of both dependency measures.

The documentation can be found in https://dcor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest

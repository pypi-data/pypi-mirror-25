Jdic Documentation
==================

1. Overview
-----------

In most projects, manipulating JSON documents requires to reinvent the
wheel on a lot of small features, or to use a varied set of external
packages. Jdic's admitted goal is to write less code with the guarantee
to get the job done fast, flawlessly and efficiently.

Jdic aims to avoid that: it is a ready-to-use type-class which eases the
manipulation of JSON-like documents, so that you can focus on logic
instead of losing time in formal document manipulations.

The Jdic class provides a lot of original features but also embeds
mission-critical 3rd party libraries and unite them all within a
comprehensive easy-to-use API.

2. Features
-----------

Here are the useful operations Jdic can do for you:

-  Transparent JSON paths integration - for read and write operations,
   through an agnostic driver model. Currently MongoDB and Jsonpath-NG
   paths formats are natively supported.

-  Fast browsing of JSON documents - browse the entire data structure
   while getting useful values on each iteration: value, JSON path,
   parent, parent JSON path, depth, etc.

-  Find, Find-Keys and Find-Match features for quickly finding any key
   or value, or subdocument matching MongoDB-like queries.

-  Merge features for fusioning objects recursively, with up to 4 modes
   for handling conflicting arrays (replace, merge, new, append).

-  Diff & Patch features - so you can represent differences between two
   documents in small data sets (diff), and apply those differences to
   update documents (patch).

-  JSON Schema validation - if you need it, with auto-validation on each
   document change.

-  Consistent document checksuming - natively SHA-256, it allows to get
   a single checksum for the document, the checksum will always be the
   same on all systems.

-  Depth features - you can crawl your document at certain depths only.

-  Strict features - input data will be serialized to a strict JSON
   format.

-  Agnostic dicts/lists replacement for Python's ``enumerate()``

-  Custom input serializer support - convert specific objects to the
   JSON data you want to.

-  Cache features with change detection to accelerate some of the API
   calls.

    >>> {"a": [{"b": 0}, {"b": 0}, {"b": 0}]}

    del('a[*].b') # Also works with del()
    >>> {"a": [{}, {}, {}]}

4. The MatchResult object
-------------------------

The MatchResult object is returned for most search operations. It
contains:

-  ``value``: the found object

-  ``path``: the full JSON path of the found object

-  ``parent``: the Jdic object containing the current found object

-  ``parent_path``: the full JSON path of the parent of the found object

-  ``key``: the current key (or index) at which the object was found
   within its parent

-  ``depth``: the depth of the object counting from the root of the Jdic

5. Jdic object instantiation
----------------------------

``jdic(obj, schema=None, serializer=None, driver=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Instantiations of Jdic objects is made through the ``jdic()`` function
which will decide for the type of Jdic object (``JdicMapping`` or
``JdicSequence``) to instantiate and return. Both those types inherit
from the Jdic class (do not use this one directly, mind the lowercase).

-  ``obj``: any list or dictionary. Sequence and Mapping equivalents
   will be casted to ``list`` and ``dict``.

-  ``schema``: optional, must be a JSON Schema in the form of a
   ``dict``. If provided, all changes affecting the Jdic will be
   validated against the schema whenever they happen.

-  ``serializer``: optional, your custom serialization function. Useless
   when ``obj`` is the result of a ``json.loads()``. It will be called
   to transform non-standard object types into standard JSON types. If
   not provided, exotic types are transformed to ``str``. It is possible
   to use ``settings.serialize_custom_function`` instead, to globally
   specify a serializing function for all the Jdic instances. A
   serializer specified as argument will always have priority over
   settings. The custom serializer function, if used, must return a JSON
   compliant data type: None, bool, str, int, float, list, dict.

-  ``driver``: optional, a string representing the driver to use
   (``mongo`` and ``jsonpath_ng`` are natively implemented). It is
   possible to use ``settings.json_path_driver`` instead, to globally
   specify a driver. Drivers specified as argument will have priority
   over settings.

Note about floating point values: objects serialized as Jdic objects
will have their floating values transformed to integers whenever the
float value is equal to its integer form. This is to make the JSON dumps
and checksums consistent and avoids '5' to be shown as '5.0'. This can
be changed by setting ``settings.serialize_float_to_int`` to ``False``.

6. Jdic objects methods
-----------------------

``browse(sort=False, depth=None, maxdepth=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Recurse on all Jdic elements, yielding a ``MatchResult`` object on each
iteration.

-  ``sort``: if True all the results will be yielded with JSON paths in
   alphabetical order.
-  ``depth``: an integer - only the results from objects at *depth* will
   be yielded.
-  ``maxdepth`` : an integer - will not recurse on documents whose depth
   is above ``maxdepth``.

``checksum(algo='sha256')``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns an ASCII checksum representing the content and data types of the
object. Checksums are consistent from an execution to another and can be
safely used for content change detection or objects comparisons. The
checksum is cached and is only recalculated if changes occured.

-  ``algo``: any algorithm supported by the ``hashlib`` Python library

``deepness()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns an integer representing the deepness of the JSON structure from
where ``deepness()`` is called. A document with no dict or list within
it has a deepness of zero. The deepness is cached and is only
recalculated if changes occured.

``depth()``
~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns an integer representing the depth of the current document from
the root of the Jdic object. The depth of the root document is 0.

``diff(obj)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns an object (a diff *stanza*) representing the differences between
the Jdic and ``obj``. ``diff()`` is implemented by the ``json_delta``
Python library.

-  ``obj``: any data

``enumerate(sort=False)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Agnostic and non-recursive enumeration of each entry in the current
object. It yields a ``(k, v)`` tuple, where ``k`` is either an integer
index when object is a list, and a string key when object is a dict.
``v`` is always the value. ``enumerate()`` is also available as a
standalone function within the Jdic package:
``from jdic import enumerate``.

-  ``sort`` : if True, sorts the dictionary keys alphabetically. Only
   sort dictionary keys, not lists.

``find(value, sort=False, limit=None, depth=None, maxdepth=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searches a value within the entire Jdic. Searches are strict (``==``).

-  ``value``: the value to search for - can be a simple type (int, str,
   etc.) or complex object (list, dict, Jdic, etc.)
-  ``sort``: if True the search results will be sorted with JSON paths
   in alphabetical order.
-  ``limit``: an integer - terminates the search when the number of
   results reaches ``limit``.
-  ``depth``: an integer - only the results from objects at *depth* will
   be yielded.
-  ``maxdepth``: an integer - will not recurse on documents whose depth
   is above ``maxdepth``.

``find_keys(keys, mode="any", sort=False, limit=None, depth=None, maxdepth=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Searches any sub-object containing ``keys``. ``keys`` can be a single
key or a list of keys. This function aims to facilitate finding
sub-objects whose keys are known.

-  ``keys``: a string or list of strings. The search will be case
   sensitive. Keys are for dicts and cannot be integer indexes of
   arrays. Keys cannot be JSON paths.
-  ``mode``: ``"any"`` or ``"all"`` - if ``"any"`` then any object
   matching any of the provided keys will be yielded. If ``"all"`` then
   any object containing all the keys will be matched.
-  ``sort``: if True the search results will be sorted with JSON paths
   in alphabetical order.
-  ``limit``: an integer - terminates the search when the number of
   results reaches ``limit``.
-  ``depth``: an integer - only the results from objects at *depth* will
   be yielded.
-  ``maxdepth``: an integer - will not recurse on documents whose depth
   is above ``maxdepth``.

``find_match(query, sort=False, limit=None, depth=None, maxdepth=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finds all objects matching positive against ``query``. Queries for
``find_match()`` are MongoDB-like queries, for both ``mongo`` and
``jsonpath_ng`` drivers. The underlying implementation is provided by
the ``mongoquery`` Python library.

-  ``query``: a MongoDB-like query. Please refer to the MongoDB
   documentation or the examples for information on queries
   structuration. Also review https://github.com/kapouille/mongoquery
   for more details on ``mongoquery`` and its known limitations.
-  ``sort``: if True the search results will be sorted with JSON paths
   in alphabetical order.
-  ``limit``: an integer - terminates the search when the number of
   results reaches ``limit``.
-  ``depth``: an integer - only the results from objects at *depth* will
   be yielded.
-  ``maxdepth``: an integer - will not recurse on documents whose depth
   is above ``maxdepth``.

``json(sort_keys=False, indent=0, ensure_ascii=False)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A helper to dump Jdic objects as serialized JSON strings.

-  ``sort_keys``: all keys will be sorted alphabetically within their
   own dicts.
-  ``indent``: number of spaces to add on new blocks.
-  ``ensure_ascii``: for a pure ASCII output (usually not recommended
   for anything else than printing binary data).

``leaves(sort=False, depth=None, maxdepth=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will yield a ``MatchResult`` on each leaf encountered in the document. A
leaf is a terminal value within the JSON documents. Basically all values
are leaves, except dicts and lists.

-  ``sort``: if True the search results will be sorted with JSON paths
   in alphabetical order.
-  ``depth``: an integer - only the results from objects at *depth* will
   be yielded.
-  ``maxdepth``: an integer - will not recurse on documents whose depth
   is above ``maxdepth``.

``nb_leaves()``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the number of leaves contained in the Jdic object. This
information is cached and is only recalculated if changes occured.

``match(query)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns ``True`` or ``False`` if the current Jdic object matches the
Mongo-like query. Unlike ``find_match()`` it will not recurse into
subdocuments. The current ``match()`` implementation is supported by the
``mongoquery`` Python library.

-  ``query``: a Mongo-like query object

``merge(*objs, arr_mode="replace")``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Will merge the current Jdic with one or multiple other objects (dicts or
lists). It is not possible to merge a Jdic of type Mapping (dict) with a
Sequence (list) or vice-versa. This limitation does not apply to
sub-documents. Note that, unlike ``patch()``, the method will change the
state of the current object. If multiple args are provided then the next
obj in ``objs`` is merged on the result of the previous merge operation,
allowing to chain the merges.

-  ``objs``: one or multiple objects of a similar type as the Jdic
   object itself.
-  ``arr_mode``: determines how are handled the merging of conflicting
   arrays (arrays who are on the same JSON path). 4 modes are supported:

   -  ``"replace"``: arrays in Jdic are simply replaced.
   -  ``"append"``: arrays from ``args`` are appended to array in Jdic.
   -  ``"new"``: elements of arrays from ``args`` are appended, but only
      if they do not exist in the Jdic array.
   -  ``"merge"``: a recursive merge is processed on the elements of the
      same index. If there are more elements in ``args`` arrays then
      those are appended in the Jdic arrays.

``new()``
~~~~~~~~~

Returns an independant copy of the current Jdic, but inheriting its
driver, schema and serializer. If the Jdic is a subdocument of another
Jdic then it loses its parenthood information (detachment).

``parent(generation=1)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the Jdic parent of the current object. The root document has no
parent (``None``).

-  ``generation``: changes the generation of the parent returned. Eg.
   ``2`` will return the grand-parent. ``0`` always returns ``None``.
   ``None`` is also returned when ``generation`` targets above the root
   Jdic document.

``patch(diff)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Applies a *diff stanza* as returned by ``diff()`` and returns a patched
version of the Jdic object, without parenthood information. The original
object is not modified. The underlying implementation is provided by the
``json_delta`` Python library.

-  ``diff``: an object returned by ``diff()``.

``path()``
~~~~~~~~~~

Returns the full JSON path of the current Jdic object. Note that the
JSON path format will depend of the current underlying driver in use.
Eg: the root path for the ``mongo`` driver is an empty string (``""``)
and ``"$"`` with the ``jsonpath_ng`` driver.

``raw()``
~~~~~~~~~

Returns a standalone non-Jdic object representing the JSON document. The
result is a ``list`` or ``dict``, depending of the type of the Jdic
document (Sequence or Mapping). This function is useful for passing a
Jdic in the form of pure Python basic types for compatibility purposes.
The results are cached and rebuilt only if changes occured.

``validate(schema=None)``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validates the current Jdic with any JSON schema provided. If no argument
is passed the Jdic is validated against its own schema, if it has any.
Note that calling ``validate()`` without argument is useless if the Jdic
is instantiated with a schema: in such case the Jdic object is
constantly validated after a change. The schema validation features are
supported by the ``jsonschema`` Python library.

-  ``schema``: a JSON schema.

7. Settings
-----------

Advanced serialization settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default Jdic will try to transform input floats into integers, if the
integer value is equal the float value (eg: float ``5.0`` is changed to
int ``5``).

The goal is trying to avoid unpredicted behaviors in serializations
operations, so we reduce the risk of detecting differences between two
objects who are both semantically and mathematically identical.

If you want to globally prevent the float to int normalization it is
possible to set ``serialize_float_to_int`` to False:

::

    from jdic import settings
    settings.serialize_float_to_int = False

This will apply to all classes.

JSON dump formatting of Jdic objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using ``str()`` on a Jdic object the default behavior is to return
a nicely formatted JSON dump, whose keys are sorted and indentation set
to 4, to ease the debugging processes and ``print()`` operations.

If you wish to send or store this dump, casting it to string with
``str()`` is not the proper way to do, prefer the ``json()`` method
instead.

If you want to change the behavior of the JSON dump through ``str()``,
you can change the settings with ``json_dump_sort_keys`` and
``json_dump_indent``:

::

    from jdic import settings
    settings.json_dump_sort_keys = False # Disables key sorting
    settings.json_dump_indent = 0 # Disables indentation

This will apply to all classes.

Changing the default driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default the JSON path driver is ``mongo``. Changing the
``json_path_driver`` to another value in the settings (eg:
``jsonpath_ng``) will change the default driver used for any future
class instantiation, unless otherwise specified in ``jdic()``
parameters:

::

    from jdic import settings
    settings.json_path_driver = "jsonpath_ng"

8. Implementing your own JSON path driver
-----------------------------------------

Create your driver as a module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Create a new folder within your project (eg: ``new_driver``)

-  Create a ``__init__.py`` file within the folder

Implementing drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, you should review an already implemented driver. The ``mongo``
driver is the best example you can use so far. It is available within
the jdic module in ``drivers/mongo/__init__.py``.

The ``__init__.py`` file must contain a ``Driver`` class whose template
is:

::

    class Driver(object):
        """The driver class"""

        @classmethod
        def add_to_path(cls, path, key):
            """Adds a key at the end of a JSON path and returns the new path"""

        @classmethod
        def control_invalid_key(cls, key):
            """ Raises an exception if a key format (not JSON path) is not valid """

        @staticmethod
        def get_new_path():
            """Returns a static JSON path pointing to the root of document"""

        @classmethod
        def get_parent(cls, obj, path):
            """Returns the parent of the value pointed by JSON path"""

        @classmethod
        def get_value_at_path(cls, obj, path):
            """Returns the value pointed by JSON path"""

        @staticmethod
        def is_a_path(key):
            """True if is a JSON path, else False"""

        @classmethod
        def is_root_path(cls, path):
            """True if is a JSON path for root document, else False"""

        @staticmethod
        def keys_to_path(keys):
            """Transforms a list of keys into a proper JSON path"""

        @staticmethod
        def match(obj, query):
            """Returns True if object matches the query, else False"""

        @staticmethod
        def path_to_keys(path):
            """Transforms an expression-less JSON path into a series of keys"""

Note that if you wish to benefit from already implemented functions, you
can inherit from any existing driver. For example, the current class
implementation of the ``jsonpath-ng`` driver inherits from the Mongo
driver allowing to reimplement only the relevant features, explaining
why the ``match()`` function is still implemented to match against Mongo
Query Language queries supported by the ``mongo`` driver.

::

    class Driver(jdic.drivers.mongo.Driver):
        ...

    show progress while downloading images for a Collection/[c]/Entity/study 
    
    Parameters
    ==========

    collection_name: the name of the collection, typically an IRB number
    output_folder: the base directory to create a study folder in
    project: Google Cloud project name
    suid: an suid of interest to query (eg, if querying an Entity, you would
          use the suid of the patient, an Image would be an suid of the
          study SUID --> (coded accession#)
    query_entity: by default, we query the entity first, and then get images.
                  to query the images (studies) set this to False.
    bucket_name: the name for the Google Storage Bucket (usually provided)
    filters: a list of tuples to apply to filter the query. Default is:

         [ ("entity_id","=", study) ]

    to retrieve all Image items that are equal to the study name

    Returns
    =======
    path to newly created image file

        Features
        --------
        
        Introduced concepts are:
        
        * Channels
            A channel is a communication endpoint capable of sending some type of message exposing a "notify" method.
        
        * Groups
            A group is a construct bringing channels together under a common entrypoint showing up as a method call of the main Notifier object.
        
        * Notifier
            The main object bringing together channels as broadcast by default and exposing methods to register and unregister channels and add and remove groups.
        
        The payload of the notification methods is by convention a dictionary with at least a "subject" and a "message" key with the appropriate values.
        It is designed like this so it can be very easy to implement much more complex structures like templates without needed any domain knowledge on all the channels.

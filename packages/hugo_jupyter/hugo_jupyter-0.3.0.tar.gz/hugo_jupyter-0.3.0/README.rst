Publish Jupyter_ notebooks with Hugo_.


* Documentation: https://knowsuchagency.github.io/hugo_jupyter
* Source: https://github.com/knowsuchagency/hugo_jupyter


Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install hugo_jupyter

Usage
-----


.. code-block:: bash

    cd root_of_hugo_project
    hugo_jupyter --init

This will create a ``notebooks`` directory at the root of your hugo project if it doesn't yet exist.
Any jupyter notebooks you want rendered should go in this directory.

Then, from the root of your hugo project, you can type ``fab serve`` to automatically initialize
your jupyter server, hugo server, and watchdog to re-render your jupyter notebooks to markdown for hugo
as you create and edit them.

Jupyter Notebooks
-----------------

Any notebooks that you create will need `front matter`_ for hugo to know how to render the content.

Early September, it’s about 3 months before PHP 7.2 is expected to be release
(schedule [here][1]). One of the changes is the removal of the mcrypt
extension after it was deprecated in PHP 7.1. The main problem with mcrypt
extension is that it is based on libmcrypt that was abandoned by it’s upstream
since 2007. That’s 10 years of keeping a library alive, moving the burden to
distribution’s security teams. But this isn’t new, Remi already wrote about
this two years ago: “[About libmcrypt and php-mcrypt][2]“.

   [1]: <https://wiki.php.net/todo/php72>

   [2]: <https://blog.remirepo.net/post/2015/07/07/About-libmcrypt-and-php-
mcrypt>

But with removal of the extension from the PHP code base (about F**King time),
it would force the recommendation was done “nicely” till now. And forcing
people means some noise, although an alternative is PHP’s owns openssl
extension. But as many migrations that require code change – it’s going slow.

The goal of this post is to reach to the PHP eco system and map the components
(mostly frameworks and applications) to still require/recommend mcyrpt and to
pressure them to fix it before PHP 72 is released. I’ll appreciate the
readers’ help with this mapping in the comments.

For example, [Laravel][3]‘s release notes for 5.1:

   [3]: <https://laravel.com>

> In previous versions of Laravel, encryption was handled by the mcrypt PHP
extension. However, beginning in Laravel 5.1, encryption is handled by the
openssl extension, which is more actively maintained.

Or, on the other hand Joomla 3 requirements still mentions mcrypt.

mcrypt safe:

  * Drupal 7 and up, see <https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/system-requirements/php>
  * Lavavel 5.1 and up, see <https://laravel.com/docs/5.1/releases>

mcrypt dependant:

  * Joomla, see <https://downloads.joomla.org/technical-requirements>
  * Magento, see <http://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/install-gde/system-requirements-tech.html>  
(Checking 2.2 RC release, as it just added support for PHP 7.1)

For those who really need mcrypt, it is part of [PECL][4], PHP’s extensions
repository. You’re welcome to compile it on your own risk.

<p>In order to easily authenticate with IRC networks such as
<a href="https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/">OFTC</a> and
<a href="https://freenode.net/kb/answer/certfp">Freenode</a>, it is possible to use
<em>client TLS certificates</em> (also known as <em>SSL certificates</em>). In fact, it
turns out that it's very easy to setup both on <a href="https://irssi.org/">irssi</a>
and on <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/">znc</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Generate_your_TLS_certificate">Generate your TLS certificate</h1>

<p>On a machine with <a href="http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/">good entropy</a>, run the
following command to create a keypair that will last for 10 years:</p>

<pre><code>openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout user.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out user.pem -subj "/CN=&lt;your nick&gt;"
</code></pre>

<p>Then extract your key fingerprint using this command:</p>

<pre><code>openssl x509 -sha1 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=//;s/://g'
</code></pre>

<h1 id="Share_your_fingerprints_with_NickServ">Share your fingerprints with NickServ</h1>

<p>On each IRC network, do this:</p>

<pre><code>/msg NickServ IDENTIFY Password1!
/msg NickServ CERT ADD &lt;your fingerprint&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in order to add your fingerprint to the access control list.</p>

<h1 id="Configure_ZNC">Configure ZNC</h1>

<p>To configure znc, start by putting the key in the right place:</p>

<pre><code>cp user.pem ~/.znc/users/&lt;your nick&gt;/networks/oftc/moddata/cert/
</code></pre>

<p>and then enable the built-in <a href="https://wiki.znc.in/Cert">cert plugin</a> for
each network in <code>~/.znc/configs/znc.conf</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Network oftc&gt;
    ...
            LoadModule = cert
    ...
&lt;/Network&gt;
    &lt;Network freenode&gt;
    ...
            LoadModule = cert
    ...
&lt;/Network&gt;
</code></pre>

<h1 id="Configure_irssi">Configure irssi</h1>

<p>For irssi, do the same thing but put the cert in <code>~/.irssi/user.pem</code> and
then change the OFTC entry in <code>~/.irssi/config</code> to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  address = "irc.oftc.net";
  chatnet = "OFTC";
  port = "6697";
  use_tls = "yes";
  tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
  tls_verify = "yes";
  autoconnect = "yes";
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the Freenode one to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  address = "chat.freenode.net";
  chatnet = "Freenode";
  port = "7000";
  use_tls = "yes";
  tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
  tls_verify = "yes";
  autoconnect = "yes";
}
</code></pre>

<p>That's it. That's all you need to replace password authentication with a
much stronger alternative.</p>

In order to easily authenticate with IRC networks such as [OFTC][1] and
[Freenode][2], it is possible to use _client TLS certificates_ (also known as
_SSL certificates_). In fact, it turns out that it's very easy to setup both
on [irssi][3] and on [znc][4].

   [1]: <https://www.oftc.net/NickServ/CertFP/>

   [2]: <https://freenode.net/kb/answer/certfp>

   [3]: <https://irssi.org/>

   [4]: <https://wiki.znc.in/>

# Generate your TLS certificate

On a machine with [good entropy][5], run the following command to create a
keypair that will last for 10 years:

    
       [5]: <http://altusmetrum.org/ChaosKey/>

    openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout user.pem -x509 -days 3650 -out user.pem -subj "/CN=<your nick>"
    

Then extract your key fingerprint using this command:

    
    
    openssl x509 -sha1 -noout -fingerprint -in user.pem | sed -e 's/^.*=//;s/://g'
    

# Share your fingerprints with NickServ

On each IRC network, do this:

    
    
    /msg NickServ IDENTIFY Password1!
    /msg NickServ CERT ADD <your fingerprint>
    

in order to add your fingerprint to the access control list.

# Configure ZNC

To configure znc, start by putting the key in the right place:

    
    
    cp user.pem ~/.znc/users/<your nick>/networks/oftc/moddata/cert/
    

and then enable the built-in [cert plugin][6] for each network in
`~/.znc/configs/znc.conf`:

    
       [6]: <https://wiki.znc.in/Cert>

    <Network oftc>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
    </Network>
        <Network freenode>
        ...
                LoadModule = cert
        ...
    </Network>
    

# Configure irssi

For irssi, do the same thing but put the cert in `~/.irssi/user.pem` and then
change the OFTC entry in `~/.irssi/config` to look like this:

    
    
    {
      address = "irc.oftc.net";
      chatnet = "OFTC";
      port = "6697";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }
    

and the Freenode one to look like this:

    
    
    {
      address = "chat.freenode.net";
      chatnet = "Freenode";
      port = "7000";
      use_tls = "yes";
      tls_cert = "~/.irssi/user.pem";
      tls_verify = "yes";
      autoconnect = "yes";
    }
    

That's it. That's all you need to replace password authentication with a much
stronger alternative.

I was recently looking for a way to extract many attachments from a series of
emails. I first had a look at the [AttachmentExtractor][1] [thunderbird][2]
plugin, but it seems very old and not maintained anymore. So I've come up with
another very simple solution that also works with any other mail client.

   [1]: <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-
US/thunderbird/addon/attachmentextractor/>

   [2]: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/>

Just copy all the mails you want to extract attachments from to a single
(temporary) mail folder, find out which file holds the mail folder and use
[ripmime][3] on that file (ripmime is packaged for [Debian][4]). For my case,
it looked like:  

    
       [3]: <http://www.pldaniels.com/ripmime/>
   [4]: <http://debian.org>

    ~ ripmime -i .icedove/XXXXXXX.default/Mail/pop.xxxx/tmp -d target-directory
    

Simple solution, but it saved me quite some time. Hope it helps !

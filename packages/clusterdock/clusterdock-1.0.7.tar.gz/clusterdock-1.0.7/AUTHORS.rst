Special thanks

- Ruthie Spivak, for tolerating/marrying me.
- `StreamSets, Inc. <https://www.streamsets.com>`_, for using this in production long before
  it was stable (which it still probably isn't).
- `Cloudera <https://www.cloudera.com>`_, for employing me during the Hackathon during
  which I wrote the first version of this project.
- Coke Zero, for being chiefly responsible for my being awake between the hours of 9 am and 5 pm.

## Overview

FBPIC is a
[Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle-in-cell)
for relativistic plasma physics.  

It is especially well-suited for physical simulations of
**laser-wakefield acceleration** and **plasma-wakefield acceleration**, with close-to-cylindrical symmetry.

### Algorithm

The distinctive feature of FBPIC is to use
a **spectral decomposition in
cylindrical geometry** (Fourier-Bessel
decomposition) for the fields. This combines the advantages of **spectral 3D** PIC codes (high accuracy and stability) and
those of **finite-difference cylindrical** PIC codes
(orders-of-magnitude speedup when compared to 3D simulations).  
For more details on the algorithm, its advantages and limitations, see
the [documentation](http://fbpic.github.io).

### Language and harware

FBPIC is written entirely in Python, but uses
[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/) Just-In-Time compiler for high
performance. In addition, the code can run on **CPU** (with multi-threading)
and on **GPU**. For large simulations, running the
code on GPU can be much faster than on CPU.

## Installation

The installation instructions below are for a local computer. For more
details, or for instructions specific to a particular HPC cluster, see
the [documentation](http://fbpic.github.io).

The recommended installation is through the
[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda) distribution.
If Anaconda is not your default Python installation, download and install
it from [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).

**Installation steps**:

- Install the dependencies of FBPIC. This can be done in two lines:
```
conda install numba=0.34 scipy h5py
conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py pyfftw
```
- Download and install FBPIC:
```
pip install fbpic
```

- **Optional:** in order to run on GPU, install the additional package
`pyculib`:
```
conda install -c numba pyculib
```

## Running simulations

Once installed, FBPIC is available as a **Python module** on your
system.

Therefore, in order to run a physical simulation, you will need a **Python
script** that imports FBPIC's functionalities and use them to setup the
simulation. You can find examples of such scripts in the
[documentation](http://fbpic.github.io) or in this repository, in `docs/source/example_input/`.

Once your script is ready, the simulation is run simply by typing:
```
python fbpic_script.py
```
The code outputs HDF5 files, that comply with the
[OpenPMD standard](http://www.openpmd.org/#/start),
 and which can thus be read as such (e.g. by using the
 [openPMD-viewer](https://github.com/openPMD/openPMD-viewer)).

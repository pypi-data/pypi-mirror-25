Description: Internet-Draft text to XML Conversion Tool
        ==========================================
        
        This tool, 'id2xml', is intended for use by the RFC-Editor staff, in order to
        produce a first xml2rfc-compatible XML version from text-only Internet-Draft
        submissions.
        
        id2xml may also be useful for Internet-Draft authors who wish to start working
        on a new version of an older draft or RFC, for which no xml2rfc-compatible XML
        source is available.
        
        Version 1.0.x can process the drafts specified in the development Statement of
        Work to XML files acceptable to xml2rfc, and can also process a number of
        other test files to acceptable XML.  Missing is internal <xref/> links to
        figures and tables.
        
        The XML produced follows RFC 7749 [1]_ in version 1.x of the tool, and will
        follow RFC 7991 [2]_ in version 2.x, which will be released once support is
        available to process XML sources which follows the RFC 7991 vocabulary.

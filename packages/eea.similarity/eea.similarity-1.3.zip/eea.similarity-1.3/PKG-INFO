        EEA Similarity
        ==============
        
        Introduction
        ============
        
        EEA Similarity is a Plone_ add-on which provides content suggestions based on similarity scores to a search string. It uses NLP algorithms like TF-IDF (frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing). 
        
        Initial use case is to provide a list of possible duplicates when adding content (based on the entered title).

        Installation
        ============
        
        zc.buildout
        -----------
        If you are using `zc.buildout`_ and the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Update your buildout.cfg file:
        
          * Add ``eea.similarity`` to the list of eggs to install
          * Tell the `plone.recipe.zope2instance`_ recipe to install a ZCML slug
        
          ::
        
            [instance]
            ...
            eggs =
              ...
              eea.similarity
        
            zcml =
              ...
              eea.similarity
        
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with::
        
          $ ./bin/buildout
        
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.
        
        Dependencies
        ============
        
        `EEA Similarity`_ has the following dependencies:
          - stemming
          - gensim (which in turn depends on numpy and scipy)
        
        On CentOS you need to install:
          - blas-devel
          - lapack-devel
          - gcc-fortran
        
        On Debian/Ubuntu you need to install:
          - libblas-dev
          - liblapack
          - gfortran
        
        Possible issues with scipy and numpy:
        -------------------------------------
        Due to a bug in scipy, it is possible that the packages will not install when
        running buildout. There are two solutions/options:
        
        1. Install them with easy_install pip before running the buildout.
        2. Update `zc.buildout`_ to version 2.9.0 and activate the wheel support via `buildout.wheel`_ and the dependencies will be installed normally.

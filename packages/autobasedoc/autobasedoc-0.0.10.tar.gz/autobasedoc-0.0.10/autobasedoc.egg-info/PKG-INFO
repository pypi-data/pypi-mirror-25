Description: autobasedoc
        ===========
        
        A small package to help automatically create reports using reportlab as
        main resource.
        
        This package uses reportlab, svglib, matplotlib and pdfrw, and does not
        provide workflows on that basis, any customization on a specific
        workflow should be avoided here.
        
        The open-source license of the corresponding packages can be obtained
        from the python package index.
        
        This package tries to be as small as possible making use of a minimum
        number of included modules. The focus of this package is in including
        matplotlib figures into the reportlab platypus work-flow, pdfrw is used
        for that purpose.
        
        Large portions are based on Examples of code, that where posted on e.g.
        stackoverflow and other internet resources, those examples all have been
        modified respecting the licenses under which they have been released,
        see LICENSE.md.

Description: # airsensor-py
        
        Python package for getting sensor values from an Ambient Air Sensor such as offered by [Rehau](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rehau-USB-Stick-Ambient-Sensor/dp/B00ZXP6EI4).
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        This section will introduce you to airsensor-py and how to install and use it for fun and profit.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Make sure that python 3 + pip is installed.
        
        ### Installing
        
        ```
        pip install airsensor-py
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        You can either use this package as a library in your code or using the bundled CLI. You'll have to run it as root or set up a udev rule to grant r/w access to the device to the user. For more instructions on that, see [here](https://github.com/tuxedo0801/usb-sensors-linux).
        
        ### Library
        
        ```
        from airsensor.core import AirSensor
        airsensor = AirSensor()
        voc = airsensor.get_voc()
        print(voc)
        
        > 450
        ```
        
        ### CLI
        
        ```
        $ airsensor-py
        
        > 450
        ```

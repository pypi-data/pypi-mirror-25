        Overview
        ---
        A Python wrapper for the [https://coinmarketcap.com/]() [api][1] that provides concise 
        functionality for extracting crypto-market data. 
        
        _This project was inspired by Martin Simon's_ [coinmarketcap-api][2] _; make sure to 
        hit his Gitub up and check out his other cool projects_.

        Dependencies
        ---
        - python `requests`
        - python `pytest`
        
        Setup
        ---
        `pip install coinwrap` _or_ `python setup.py install`
        
        Usage
        ---
        ```
        from coinwrap import Market
        market = Market()
        market.coin('bitcoin')
        market.coin('bitcoin', limit=2)
        market.coin('bitcoin', limit=2, convert='EUR')
        market.stats()
        ```
        
        Test
        ---
        ```
        python -m coinwrap.test.test_core
        pytest [-s]
        ```
        
        Note
        ---
        The _-s_ option for `pytest` prints the output along with the test results. The `-m` 
        option and following line format is necessary for Python to interpret the files as 
        modules/packages and then run them as scripts. The distinction here stemming from 
        the use of relative imports (as can be seen in the coinwrap/\_\_init\_\_.py and 
        coinwrap/test/test\_core.py files).
        
        _The test only applies if you are within the_ __coinwrap__ _directory that_ `pip` 
        _installs source distributions in_.

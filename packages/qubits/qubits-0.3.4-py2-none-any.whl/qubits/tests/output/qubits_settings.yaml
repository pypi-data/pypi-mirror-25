## K-CORRECTION GENERATION ##
Observed Frame Filter for K-corrections: g # This is the filter that the k-corrections are anchored to. The simulations will convert from this observed band magnitude to the rest frame magnitudes to calculate the k-correction.
K-correction temporal resolution (days): 1.0 # Only increase the resolution here if you have many spectra in your database and k-corrections are taking too long to generate.
Order of polynomial used to fits k-corrections: 7
Minimum number of datapoints used to generate k-correction curve: 3 # If the are not enough spectra or too many spectra have been redshifted out of the range of the observed frame band-pass, then there are few points to generate a polynomial k-correction lightcurve. 3 is probably the barely-passable minimum.

## SIMULATED UNIVERSE CONSTRAINTS ##
CCSN Progenitor Population Fraction of IMF: 0.007
Transient to CCSN Ratio: 10e-5
Simulation Sample: 200 # Number of transients to include in simulations. More = more accurate but sims take longer to run. 100 good for testing & 10,000 good for science.
Extinctions:
    constant or random: constant # Feature not yet implemented - leave as `constant`
    constant E(b-v): 0.023 # 0.023 is the mean for the PS1-MD fields

## LIGHTCURVE GENERATION & CONSTRAINTS
Lightcurves:
    SNOne:
        End of lightcurve relative to peak: 300
    SNTwo:
        End of lightcurve relative to peak: 220
Order of polynomial used to fits lightcurves: 6
# Often it is useful to set a an explosion day (relative to the timescale used in naming the files in the spectral database).
# This helps constrain the polynomials of the light- and K-correction- curves generated in the simulations.
# SET TO `None` TO DISREGARD THIS SETTING
Explosion Days:
    SNTwo: -70
    SNOne: -70
# You can also extend the tail of the lightcurve to better constrain the polynomial. Set to `True` or `False`
Extend lightcurve tail?:
    SNTwo: True
    SNOne: True

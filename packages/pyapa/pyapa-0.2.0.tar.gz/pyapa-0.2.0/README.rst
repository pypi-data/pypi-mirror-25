pyapa
=====

A Python module for checking APA style in writing.

This module provides an abstraction class, mostly composed of regular
expressions. This project does not aim to cover the entire APA style
guide, but it does attempt to cover several common errors with style.

To make errors easier to visually locate, 5 characters of context are
sometimes given, depending on the detected error.

pyapa.ApaCheck object class
---------------------------

This class documents regular expressions to match style errors.

The `pyapa.ApaCheck.match()` method generates an array of ApaMatch objects
and stores them in the `ApaCheck.Matches` list for easy access.


pyapa.ApaMatch object class
---------------------------

This class contains the following members:

* `ApaMatch.feedback` a unicode string intended to hold a brief
  explanation of an associated error
* `ApaMatch.see` a URL string intended to hold an external reference to an APA
  Style guide
* `ApaMatch.end` the position of the character in a text which marks
  the end of the target character span
* `ApaMatch.start` the position of the character in a text which marks
  the beginning of the target character span
* `ApaMatch.target` the matching string that contains an error
* `ApaMatch.suggestions` a list of suggested replacement strings; at
  this time, the list is only ever one element long

There are also two helper functions to make printing these objects easy:

* `ApaMatch.print()` prints the object to stdout
* `ApaMatch.sprint()` builds a string containing information about the object


Example usage
-------------

From the interpreter:

>>> from pyapa import pyapa
>>> a = pyapa.ApaCheck()
>>> text = u'Papaya are delicious fruit, it was concluded (Author, et al. 2017).'
>>> a.match(text)
[<pyapa.pyapa.ApaMatch object at 0x000000000000>]
>>> len(a.Matches)
1
>>> a.Matches[0].print()
Match from 46 to 65 for:
Target: Author, et al. 2017
Feedback: Do not put a comma before 'et al.'
Suggestion: Author et al. 2017


Calling the module itself:

::

    python3 -m pyapa -i input.txt
    python3 -m pyapa -h
    Usage:
    pyapa [-h] [--version] [-o OUTPUT_FILE] -i INPUT_FILE

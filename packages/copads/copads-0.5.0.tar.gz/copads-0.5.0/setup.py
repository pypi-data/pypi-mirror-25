  The main aim of Collection of Python Algorithms and Data Structures (COPADS) 
  is to develop a compilation of Python data structures and its algorithms, 
  making it almost a purely developmental project. Personally, I look at this 
  as a re-usable collection of tools that I can use in other projects. 
  Therefore, this project is essentially "needs-driven", except a core subset 
  of data structures and algorithms.

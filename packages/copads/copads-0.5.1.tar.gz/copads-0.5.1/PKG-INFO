Description: 
          The main aim of Collection of Python Algorithms and Data Structures (COPADS) 
          is to develop a compilation of Python data structures and its algorithms, 
          making it almost a purely developmental project. Personally, I look at this 
          as a re-usable collection of tools that I can use in other projects. 
          Therefore, this project is essentially "needs-driven", except a core subset 
          of data structures and algorithms.

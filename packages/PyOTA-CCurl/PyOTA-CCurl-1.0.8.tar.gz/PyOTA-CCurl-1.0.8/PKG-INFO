Description: C Curl Extension for PyOTA
        ==========================
        This is an extension for the crypto functionality in `PyOTA <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyOTA>`_, the Python API
        for IOTA.  When installed, it will significantly boost the performance of
        PyOTA's crypto functionality.
        
        This extension is installed as an add-on to the ``pyota`` package::
        
           pip install pyota[ccurl]
        
        After running the above command, you can verify that the C extension is
        installed correctly by running the ``check_ccurl`` command in your shell::
        
           > check_ccurl
           ðŸ˜¸  CCurl is installed correctly!
           For support, visit the #iota-libs-pyota channel on the IOTA Slack.

        Compatibility
        -------------
        This extension is compatible with Python 3.6, 3.5 and 2.7.
        
        Testing
        -------
        The easiest way to test the extension is to install it and then run the PyOTA unit tests.
        
        Here's a modified ``tox.ini`` file that for PyOTA that will install the C extension before running unit tests::
        
           [tox]
           envlist = py27, py35, py36
        
           [testenv]
           commands =
             pip install --pre pyota-ccurl
             nosetests
           deps =
             mock
             nose
        
        Note that this file needs to be installed in the PyOTA codebase!

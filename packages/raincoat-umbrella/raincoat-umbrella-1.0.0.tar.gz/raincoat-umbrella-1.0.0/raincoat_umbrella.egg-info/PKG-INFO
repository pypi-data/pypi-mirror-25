        ========
        
        This package is not very interesting :)
        
        I feel a little bad to upload a "useless" package to the real PyPI, but the
        existence of this package will allow writing a much clearer tutorial in the
        documentation of `Raincoat <https://pypi.org/pypi/raincoat>`_.
        
        Thank you !
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Launch the command ``umbrella``.
        
        Move and open/close the umbrella with the arrow keys.
        
        Stare at the rain and find you inner peace.
        
        When you're done, quit with ``q``.

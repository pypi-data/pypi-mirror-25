Description:  Quail is a Python package that facilitates analyses of behavioral data from memory experiments. (The current focus is on free recall experiments.) Key features include:
        - Serial position curves (probability of recalling items presented at each presentation position)
        - Probability of Nth recall curves (probability of recalling items at each presentation position as the Nth recall in the recall sequence)
        - Lag-Conditional Response Probability curves (probability of transitioning between items in the recall sequence, as a function of their relative presentation positions)
        - Clustering metrics (e.g. single-number summaries of how often participants transition from recalling a word to another related word, where "related" can be user-defined.)
        - Many nice plotting functions
        - Convenience functions for loading in data
        - Automatically parse speech data (audio files) using wrappers for the Google Cloud Speech to Text API

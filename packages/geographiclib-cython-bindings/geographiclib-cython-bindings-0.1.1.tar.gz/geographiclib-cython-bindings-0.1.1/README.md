# How to build a Cython extension module for `geographiclib`

## Prerequisites

The following instructions are tested for Ubuntu 16.04, Amazon Linux, and macOS Sierra 10.12.

You will need the C++ `geographiclib` library (for compile-time and for run-time, too).

- Option 1 (recommended for Ubuntu and macOS): Install `libgeographic-dev` package, however it looks like the built-from-sources version is fresher.

  Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y libgeographic-dev
    ```
  macOS:
    ```bash
    brew install geographiclib
    ```

- Option 2 (recommended for Ubuntu and Amazon Linux): Compile and install it from sources.
  This creates bunch of `*.hpp` in `/usr/local/include/GeographicLib/` and `/usr/local/lib/libGeographic.so`:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth=1 git://git.code.sourceforge.net/p/geographiclib/code geographiclib

    cd geographiclib
    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD

    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
    ```
  See [installation manual](https://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/html/install.html) in case of problems.

For development, you will also need Cython:
```bash
pip install cython
```

## Description

There are two Cython files: `cgeographiclib.pxd` describing the C++ API of the `libGeographic` library, and `geographiclib_cython.pyx` describing classes that will be visible from Python user code. 
The `.pyx` imports `.pxd` to learn about C++ classes and functions available to be called.

We wrap C++ classes `Geodesic` and `GeodesicLine` into Cython classes `PyGeodesic` and `PyGeodesicLine`. 
Additionally, we define a pure Python class `Geodesic` with a single field `WGS84` to mimic the behavior of the official `geographiclib` package.

There is also `setup.py` file. 
This file describes how to build the extension module, using `distutils`.
In there, we specify the library to link with as `libraries=['Geographic']`. The `Geographic` stands for `libGeographic.so` that we previously installed.

There are two options to build the package:
- One, use Cython's `cythonize()` function to generate a `.cpp` file from the `.pyx` one, and then compile it against the `libGeographic.so` library.
- Two, if the `.cpp` is already provided, just compile it - no Cython required!

## Development build

For development, use option 1 by providing `--cython` flag:

```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace --cython
```

The result will be a `.so` shared library named like `geographiclib_cython.cpython-35m-x86_64-linux-gnu.so`. 
`build_ext` means we're building a C++ extension. `--inplace` means to put it in the current directory.
If you run `python` from current directory, you'll be able to `import geographiclib_cython`.

## Distribute

To distribute, call `sdist` with `--cython` flag to create source distribution (unbuilt):

```bash
python setup.py sdist --cython
```

The result will be a `dist/` directory with a distribution named like `geographiclib-cython-bindings-1.0.0.tar.gz` inside.
The archive contains `setup.py` and `geographiclib_cython.cpp`, so users can build and install it without having Cython!

## Install

To install, locate the `.tar.gz` distribution and run:
```bash
pip install geographiclib-cython-bindings-1.0.0.tar.gz
```

For conda, you might need to activate your environment first:

```bash
$ which pip
/home/vagrant/.local/bin/pip

$ source activate root

(root) $ which pip
/home/vagrant/anaconda3/bin/pip
```

## Usage

Let's try to import and use it!

```bash
$ ipython
Python 3.5.2 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:53:06)
Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
IPython 6.0.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.

## Gotchas
- If you get this error when doing `import Geodesic`:
```
ImportError: libGeographic.so.17: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```
This means that Python interpreter can't find the shared library. For some reason, `/usr/local/lib` is not searched by default. We need to provide it in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. If you have installed `libGeographic.so` somewhere else, provide that directory instead.
```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
```

- If you get this error when doing `import Geodesic`:
```bash
ImportError: /opt/anaconda/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found (required by /usr/local/lib/libGeographic.so.17)
```
Do this (solution found [here](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/4953)):
```bash
conda install libgcc
```

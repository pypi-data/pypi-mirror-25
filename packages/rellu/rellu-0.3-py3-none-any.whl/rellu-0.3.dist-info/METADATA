rellu -- Tooling to ease creating releases
==========================================

This project contains tools and utilities to ease creating releases
on GitHub and publishing them on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
Designed to be used by `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`_
and other tools and libraries in its ecosystem but can naturally be
used also by others.

Uses `invoke <http://pyinvoke.org>`_ internally and has it as a dependency.
Requires Python 3.6 or newer.

.. warning:: Currently work-in-progress!

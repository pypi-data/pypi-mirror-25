Description: rellu -- Tooling to ease creating releases
        ==========================================
        
        This project contains tools and utilities to ease creating releases
        on GitHub and publishing them on `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org>`_.
        Designed to be used by `Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`_
        and other tools and libraries in its ecosystem but can naturally be
        used also by others.
        
        Uses `invoke <http://pyinvoke.org>`_ internally and has it as a dependency.
        Requires Python 3.6 or newer.
        
        .. warning:: Currently work-in-progress!

Description: # Wfuzz - The Web Fuzzer
        
        ## What is this?
        
        Wfuzz is a tool designed to fuzz web applications, it's very flexible, it supports:
        	
        - Recursion (when doing directory discovery)
        - Post data bruteforcing
        - Header bruteforcing
        - Output to HTML (easy for just clicking the links and checking the page, even with postdata!)
        - Colored output 
        - Hide results by return code, word numbers, line numbers, etc.
        - Url encoding
        - Cookies
        - Multithreading
        - Proxy support 
        - All parameter fuzzing
        - etc
        
        It was created to facilitate the task in web applications assessments, it's a tool by pentesters for pentesters ;)
        
        ## How does it works?
        
        The tool is based on dictionaries or ranges, then you choose where you want to bruteforce just by replacing the value by the word FUZZ.

Parallel Python module (PP) provides an easy and efficient way to create parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters. PP module features cross-platform portability and dynamic load balancing. Thus application written with PP will parallelize efficiently even on heterogeneous and multi-platform clusters (including clusters running other application with variable CPU loads).

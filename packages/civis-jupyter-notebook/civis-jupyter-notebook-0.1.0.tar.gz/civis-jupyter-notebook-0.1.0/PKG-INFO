        A tool to enable any Docker image to be used with Civis Platform Jupyter notebooks.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        In your ``Dockerfile``, put the following code at the end::
        
            ENV SHELL=/bin/bash \
                DEFAULT_KERNEL=<your kernel>
        
            RUN pip install civis-jupyter-notebook && \
                civis-jupyter-notebooks-install
        
            EXPOSE 8888
            WORKDIR /root/work
            CMD ["civis-jupyter-notebooks-start", "--allow-root"]
        
        Here you need to replace ``<your kernel>`` with the name of your kernel (e.g.,
        one of ``python2``, ``python3``, or ``ir``). Note that your Dockerfile must use
        `root` as the default user.

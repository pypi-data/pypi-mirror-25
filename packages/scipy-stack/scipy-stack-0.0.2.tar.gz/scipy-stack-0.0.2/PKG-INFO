        ===========================
        
        This package simply has the packages that are part of the scipy stack as dependencies, defined
        here: https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html
        
        This package is unofficial and contains no code. running 'pip install scipy-stack' will
        install all official scipy-stack packages, if your system is able to compile them. Note that 
        this will install the non-MKL version of numpy. Windows users may have trouble installing
        Scipy using this package, even with a C-compiler configured.

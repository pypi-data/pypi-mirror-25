SciPy Stack download helper
===========================

This package simply requires the packages that are part of the scipy stack, defined
here: https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html

This package is unofficial and contains no code. running 'pip install scipy-stack' will
install all official scipy-stack packages, if your system is able to compile them. Note that 
this will install the non-MKL version of numpy. Windows users may have trouble installing
Scipy using this package, even with a C-compiler configured.

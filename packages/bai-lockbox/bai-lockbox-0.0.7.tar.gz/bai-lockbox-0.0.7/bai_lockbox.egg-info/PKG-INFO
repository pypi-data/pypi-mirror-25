Description: # bai-lockbox
        
        
        A simple parser for files in the BAI lockbox format in order to extract checks
        from them.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        To install `bai-lockbox`:
        
        ```
        $ pip install bai-lockbox
        ```
        
        
        ## Warning
        
        Please be aware that this code was written to the spec that our bank uses, and
        has been tested with data that has come from them. This means that there may be
        subtle (and maybe some not-so-subtle) differences between the the data we expect
        and the data you get. If our parser doesn't read your files, open an issue or
        submit a PR. We'd really appreciate it!
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        
        from lockbox.parser import LockboxFile
        with open('/path/to/file', 'r') as inf:
            lockbox_file = LockboxFile.from_file(inf)
        
        for check in lockbox_file.checks:
            print('Received ${} from {} on {}'.format(
                check.amount, check.sender, check.date
            ))
        ```

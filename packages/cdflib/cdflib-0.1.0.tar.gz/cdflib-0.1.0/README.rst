This is a python script to read ISTP-compliant CDF V3 files
without needing to install the CDF NASA library.  

CDF Inquiry:  cdf_info()
              Returns a dictionary that shows the basic CDF information. This
              information includes:
              ['CDF']: the name of the CDF
              ['Version']: the version of the CDF
              ['Encoding']: the endianness of the CDF
              ['Majority']: the row/column majority
              ['zVariables']: the dictionary for zVariable numbers and their
                              corresponding names
              ['rVariables']: the dictionary for rVariable numbers and their
                              corresponding names
              ['Attributes']: the dictionary for attribute numbers and their
                              corresponding names and scopes


Variable Information:
              var_info(variable)
              Returns a dictionary that shows the basic variable information.
              This information includes:
              ['Variable']: the name of the variable
              ['Num']: the variable number
              ['Var_Type']: the variable type: zVariable or rVariable
              ['Data_Type']: the variable's CDF data type
              ['Num_Elements']: the number of elements of the variable
              ['Num_Dims']: the dimensionality of the variable record
              ['Dim_Sizes']: the shape of the variable record
              ['Sparse']: the variable's record sparseness
              ['Last_Rec']: the maximum written record number (0-based)


Attribute Inquiry:  attinq( attribute )
                    Returns a python dictionary of attribute information
                   
Get Attribute(s):   attget( attribute, entry_number|variable_name [,to_dict=True] )
                    Returns the value of the attribute at the entry number
                    provided.  For a variable attribute, variable name can be
                    used, instead of its corresponding entry number. By
                    default, it returns a 'numpy.ndarray', 'list' or 'str' 
                    class object, depending on the attribute data and its data
                    type. If to_dict is set as True, a dictionary is returned
                    with the following defined keys:
                    ['Item_Size']: the number of bytes for each entry value
                    ['Num_Items']: total number of values extracted
                    ['Data_Type']: the CDF data type
                    ['Data']: retrieved attribute data as a scalar value, a
                              list of values or a string

                    varattsget(variable)
                    Unlike attget, which returns a single attribute entry value,
                    this function returns all of the variable attribute entries,
                    in a dictionary (in the form of 'attribute': value pair) for
                    a variable. If there is no entry found, None is returned.
                   
                    globalattsget()
                    This function returns all of the global attribute entries,
                    in a dictionary (in the form of 'attribute': {entry: value}
                    pair) from a CDF. If there is no entry found, None is
                    returned.
                   
Variable Inquiry:   varinq( variable )
                    Returns a python dictionary of variable information 
                   
Get Variable:       varget( variable, [epoch=None], [[starttime=None, 
                            endtime=None] | [startrec=None, endrec = None]],
                            [,to_dict=True])
                    Returns the variable data. Variable can be entered either
                    a name or a variable number. By default, it returns a
                    'numpy.ndarray' or 'list' class object, depending on the
                    data type, with the variable data and its specification.
                    If to_dict is set as True, a dictionary is returned
                    with the following defined keys for the output:
                    ['Rec_Ndim']: the dimension number of each variable record
                    ['Rec_Shape']: the shape of the variable record dimensions
                    ['Num_Records']: the number of the retrieved records
                    ['Item_Size']: the number of bytes for each data value
                    ['Data_Type']: the CDF data type
                    ['Data']: retrieved variable data, a list of values
                              reflecting how they are stored in the file.
                    By default, the full variable data is returned. To acquire
                    only a portion of the data for a record-varying variable,
                    either the time or record (0-based) range can be specified.
                    'epoch' can be used to specify which time variable this 
                    variable depends on and is to be searched for the time range.
                    For the ISTP-compliant CDFs, the time variable will come from
                    the attribute 'DEPEND_0' from this variable. The function will
                    automatically search for it thus no need to specify 'epoch'.
                    If either the start or end time is not specified,
                    the possible minimum or maximum value for the specific epoch
                    data type is assumed. If either the start or end record is not
                    specified, the range starts at 0 or/and ends at the last of the
                    written data.  

Note: CDF's CDF_EPOCH16 data type uses 2 8-byte doubles for each data value.
      In Python, each vale is presented as a complex or numpy.complex128.

Get epoch range:    epochrange( epoch, [starttime=None, endtime=None])
                    Returns a list of the record numbers, representing the
                    corresponding starting and ending records within the time
                    range from the epoch data. A None is returned if there is no
                    data either written or found in the time range.

This module also imports CDFepoch that handles CDF-based epochs.

    There are three (3) epoch data types in CDD: CDF_EPOCH, CDF_EPOCH16 and 
    CDF_TIME_TT2000. CDF_EPOCH is milliseconds since Year 0. CDF_EPOCH16
    is picoseconds since Year 0. CDF_TIME_TT2000 (TT2000 as short) is 
    nanoseconds since J2000 with leap seconds. CDF_EPOCH is a single double
    (as float in Python), CDF_EPOCH16 is 2-doubles (as complex in Python),
    and TT2000 is 8-byte integer (as int in Python). In Numpy, they are 
    np.float64, np.complex128 and np.int64, respectively. All these epoch
    values can come from from CDF.varget function.

    Four main functions are provided:

      encode (epochs, iso_8601=None)
         Encodes the epoch(s) into UTC string(s).
         For CDF_EPOCH: The input should be either a float or list of floats
                        (in numpy, a np.float64 or a np.ndarray of np.float64)
                        Each epoch is encoded, by default to a ISO 8601 form:
                        2004-05-13T15:08:11.022 
                        Or, if iso_8601 is set to False,
                        13-May-2004 15:08:11.022
         For CDF_EPOCH16: The input should be either a complex or list of 
                          complex
                          (in numpy, a np.complex128 or a np.ndarray of 
                           np.complex128)
                          Each epoch is encoded, by default to a ISO 8601 form:
                          2004-05-13T15:08:11.022033044055 
                          Or, if iso_8601 is set to False,
                          13-May-2004 15:08:11.022.033.044.055
         For TT2000: The input should be either a int or list of ints
                     (in numpy, a np.int64 or a np.ndarray of np.int64)
                     Each epoch is encoded, by default to a ISO 8601 form:
                     2008-02-02T06:08:10.10.012014016
                     Or, if iso_8601 is set to False,
                     02-Feb-2008 06:08:10.012.014.016

      breakdown (epochs, to_np=None)
         Breaks down the epoch(s) into UTC components. 
         For CDF_EPOCH: they are 7 date/time components: year, month, day,
                        hour, minute, second, and millisecond
         For CDF_EPOCH16: they are 10 date/time components: year, month, day,
                          hour, minute, second, and millisecond, microsecond,
                          nanosecond, and picosecond.
         For TT2000: they are 9 date/time components: year, month, day,
                     hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, 
                     nanosecond.
         Specify to_np to True, if the result should be in numpy class.

      compute (datetimes, to_np=None)
      compute_epoch (datetimes, to_np=None)
      compute_epoch16 (datetimes, to_np=None)
      compute_tt2000 (datetimes, to_np=None)
         Computes the provided date/time components into CDF epoch value(s).
         For computing into CDF_EPOCH value, each date/time elements should 
         have exactly seven (7) components, as year, month, day, hour, minute,
         second and millisecond, in a list. For example:
         [[2017,1,1,1,1,1,111],[2017,2,2,2,2,2,222]]
         Or, call function compute_epoch directly, instead, with at least three
         (3) first (up to seven) components. The last component, if
         not the 7th, can be a float that can have a fraction of the unit.
         For CDF_EPOCH16, they should have exactly ten (10) components, as year, 
         month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, nanosecond 
         and picosecond, in a list. For example:
         [[2017,1,1,1,1,1,123,456,789,999],[2017,2,2,2,2,2,987,654,321,999]]
         Or, call function compute_epoch directly, instead, with at least three
         (3) first (up to ten) components. The last component, if
         not the 10th, can be a float that can have a fraction of the unit.
         Each TT2000 typed date/time should have exactly nine (9) components, as 
         year, month, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond, microsecond, 
         and nanosecond, in a list.  For example:
         [[2017,1,1,1,1,1,123,456,789],[2017,2,2,2,2,2,987,654,321]]
         Or, call function compute_tt2000 directly, instead, with at least three
         (3) first (up to nine) components. The last component, if
         not the 9th, can be a float that can have a fraction of the unit.
         Specify to_np to True, if the result should be in numpy class.

      findepochrange (epochs, starttime=None, endtime=None)
         Finds the record range within the start and end time from values 
         of a CDF epoch data type. It returns a list of record numbers. 
         If the start time is not provided, then it is 
         assumed to be the minimum possible value. If the end time is not 
         provided, then the maximum possible value is assumed. The epoch is
         assumed to be in the chronological order. The start and end times
         should have the proper number of date/time components, corresponding
         to the epoch's data type.

Sample use - 

    import pds_cdf
	
    swea_cdf_file = pds_cdf.CDF('/path/to/swea_file.cdf')
	
    x = swea_cdf_file.varget("NameOfVariable")

    swea_cdf_file.close()

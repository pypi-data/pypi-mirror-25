coveralls-check
================

A small helper to check https://coveralls.io for a given commit hash.

Development takes place here:
https://github.com/cjw296/coveralls-check/

Usage
-----

This was designed for use with Travis CI `Build Stages`__ where you want
to check code coverage before doing a deployment or release.

__ https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/build-stages/

A sample ``.travis.yml`` using it is as follows::

    language: python

    sudo: false

    python:
      - "2.7"
      - "3.6"

    install:
      - "pip install --upgrade pip setuptools"
      - "pip install -Ue .[test]"

    script: coverage run --source ... -m py.test

    after_success:
      - coveralls

    jobs:
      include:

        - stage: coverage
          python: 3.6
          after_success: skip

          install: "pip install -U coveralls-check"
          script: "coveralls-check $TRAVIS_COMMIT"

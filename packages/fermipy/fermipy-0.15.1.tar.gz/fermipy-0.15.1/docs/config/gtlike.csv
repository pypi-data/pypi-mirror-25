``bexpmap``	None	
``bexpmap_roi``	None	
``convolve``	True	
``edisp``	True	Enable the correction for energy dispersion.
``edisp_disable``	None	Provide a list of sources for which the edisp correction should be disabled.
``expscale``	None	Exposure correction that is applied to all sources in the analysis component.  This correction is superseded by `src_expscale` if it is defined for a source.
``irfs``	None	Set the IRF string.
``llscan_npts``	20	Number of evaluation points to use when performing a likelihood scan.
``minbinsz``	0.05	Set the minimum bin size used for resampling diffuse maps.
``resample``	True	
``rfactor``	2	
``src_expscale``	None	Dictionary of exposure corrections for individual sources keyed to source name.  The exposure for a given source will be scaled by this value.  A value of 1.0 corresponds to the nominal exposure.
``srcmap``	None	Set the source maps file.  When defined this file will be used instead of the local source maps file.
``use_external_srcmap``	False	Use an external precomputed source map file.
``wmap``	None	Likelihood weights map.

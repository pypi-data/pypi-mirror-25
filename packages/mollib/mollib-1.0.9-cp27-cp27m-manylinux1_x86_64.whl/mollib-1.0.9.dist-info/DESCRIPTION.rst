Mollib is a unified command-line program and Python library for the
validation, quality analysis and manipulation of molecular structures with an
emphasis on biophysical analysis. Mollib is built on a plugin framework to
easily add new tools to manipulate and analyze structures and data, which can
then be *combined* and *cross-validated*.

Mollib includes tools for:

- The processing and protonation of molecules.
- The analysis of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen bond quality compared to the 
  highest-resolution PDB structures. Hydrogen bonds are classified based on 
  their acceptor-donor residues and Ramachandran angles
- The measurement of geometries within molecules as well as the reporting and 
  classification of Ramachandran angles.
- The statistical analysis and comparison of structures to high-resolution
  crystal structures.
- The analysis of partial alignment data with residual dipolar coupling (RDC) 
  and residual anisotropic chemical shift (RACS, a.k.a RCSA) data.

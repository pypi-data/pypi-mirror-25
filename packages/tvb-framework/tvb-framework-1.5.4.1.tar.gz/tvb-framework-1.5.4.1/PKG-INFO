Description: TVB FRAMEWORK
        =============
        
        The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:
        
        -  a plugable workflow manager;
        -  a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
        -  an HTML5 based user interface;
        -  visualizers for neuro-science related entities.
        
        The easiest way to make use of the code from this Git repo is to obtain
        a Distribution of TVB with Python and all the necessary packages linked,
        and then clone this repo nearby. More details `in our
        documentation <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html>`__.
        
        Alternatively, if you plan to develop long term with TVB, extensively
        modify code, add new dependencies, or you simply prefer to use your own
        Python installation, you may want to use the
        `tvb-pack <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-pack>`__ repo which
        gathers together several required modules and a few helpful TVB tools.
        You will need in this case to setup your machine alone. Few guidelines
        can be found
        `here <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html#the-unaided-setup>`__.
        
        If you don't require the framework features listed above, the simulator
        and associated scientific modules can be used independently; please see
        the `tvb-library <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-library>`__
        repo.

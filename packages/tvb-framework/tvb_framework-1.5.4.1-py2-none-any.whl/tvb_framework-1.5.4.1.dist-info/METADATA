TVB FRAMEWORK
=============

The Virtual Brain framework is a complete framework including:

-  a plugable workflow manager;
-  a data persistence layer (with a relational DB and File Storage);
-  an HTML5 based user interface;
-  visualizers for neuro-science related entities.

The easiest way to make use of the code from this Git repo is to obtain
a Distribution of TVB with Python and all the necessary packages linked,
and then clone this repo nearby. More details `in our
documentation <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html>`__.

Alternatively, if you plan to develop long term with TVB, extensively
modify code, add new dependencies, or you simply prefer to use your own
Python installation, you may want to use the
`tvb-pack <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-pack>`__ repo which
gathers together several required modules and a few helpful TVB tools.
You will need in this case to setup your machine alone. Few guidelines
can be found
`here <http://docs.thevirtualbrain.org/manuals/ContributorsManual/ContributorsManual.html#the-unaided-setup>`__.

If you don't require the framework features listed above, the simulator
and associated scientific modules can be used independently; please see
the `tvb-library <https://github.com/the-virtual-brain/tvb-library>`__
repo.

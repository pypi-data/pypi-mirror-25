Description: 
        This module implements an event dispatcher based on the publish-subscribe
        pattern using asyncio.  It is akin to the QT library's signals and slots
        mechanism.  Pubmarine's PubSub is intended for asynchronous signalling within
        an application.  It is not meant for communicating with other programs over
        the network.

        ============
        
        Assuming you've cloned the project and created a virtualenv, run the following command to work with the code.
        
            $ virtualenv --python python3 venv
            $ source venv/bin/activate
            $ pip install -e .[test]
        
        To test the code, run the following command.
        
            $ python setup.py test
        
        Notes
        =====
        
        This is a fork of my old `imageDownloader`__ repository which did the same thing but as a bash script and for the previous version of nhl.com
        
        __ https://github.com/blindman/imageDownloader
        
        You may have noticed that `nhl.com`__ is requested and parsed to find ::code`nhl-logos.css` instead of retrieving the css file directly. This is because (I believe) the path to that file could potentially change. The current path is ::code::`.../builds/.../f0683b50089da6c16c1df297a9a74ce08e79b94b_1507226889/.../nhl-logos.css` and since the big chunk in the middle looks like a unique identifier I am going to assume it will change. I am looking to implement some sort of caching so it doesn't make a request every time.

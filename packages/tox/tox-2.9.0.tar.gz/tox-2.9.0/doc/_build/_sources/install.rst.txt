tox installation
================

Installation with pip
---------------------

Use the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install tox

It is fine to install ``tox`` itself into a virtualenv_ environment.

Install from Checkout
---------------------

Consult the GitHub page to get a checkout of the git repository:

    https://github.com/tox-dev/tox

and then install in your environment with something like:

.. code-block:: shell

    python setup.py install

or just activate your checkout in your environment like this:

.. code-block:: shell

    python setup.py develop

so that you can do changes and submit patches.

.. include:: _shared-links.rst

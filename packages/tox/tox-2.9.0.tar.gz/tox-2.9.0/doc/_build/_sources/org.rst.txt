Historical information
----------------------

Less announcing, more change-logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With version 2.5.0 we dropped creating special announcement documents and rely on communicating
all relevant changes through the
`CHANGELOG <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst>`_. See at
`pypi <https://pypi.org/project/tox/>`_ for a rendered version of the last changes containing
links to the important issues and pull requests that were integrated into the release.

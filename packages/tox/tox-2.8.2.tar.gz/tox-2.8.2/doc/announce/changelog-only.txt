Less announcing, more changelogging
-----------------------------------

With version 2.5.0 we dropped creating special announcement documents and rely on communicating all relevant changes through the `CHANGELOG
<https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/blob/master/CHANGELOG>`_. See https://pypi.org/project/tox/ for a rendered version of the last changes containing links to the imporant issues and pull requests that were integrated into the release.

Happy testing,
The tox maintainers

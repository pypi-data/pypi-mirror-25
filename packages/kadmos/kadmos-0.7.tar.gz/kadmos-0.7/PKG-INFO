Description: Introduction
        =============
        
        KADMOS (Knowledge- and graph-based Agile Design with Multidisciplinary Optimization System) is a new software system which is currently being developed in the [AGILE](http://www.agile-project.eu/) innovation project. It aims at increasing the agility of aircraft design teams that perform multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO). By increased agility, an MDO-based development process is meant that better fits the iterative nature of performing aircraft design. KADMOS has been developed on the notion that performing MDO is analogous to performing music with a large symphonic orchestra, however, in the MDO domain a music notation system is missing, which prevents us from composing large, complex pieces. 
        
        Repository Structure
        ====================
        
        The repository is structured as follows:

        	  contains copies of all major distributions of KADMOS
        
        - docs/
        
              contains the documentation
        
        - examples/
        
              contains two example knowlegde bases and scripts
        	  
        	 
        - kadmos/
        
              contains the main code for KADMOS
        
        	  - cmdows
        	  
        		 contains tools for interacting with CMDOWS files
        	  
              - external

              - graph
        
                 contains the main graph-based logic for KADMOS
        
              - interface
        
                 contains a script for launching a web-based interface for accessing a few KADMOS functionalities

        =======
        
        KADMOS is currently being developed at [TU Delft](https://tudelft.nl) by [Imco van Gent](https://bitbucket.org/imcovangent/) as an open source project. KADMOS can still be considered as an early beta and is subjected to change. Ideas and improvement suggestions are greatly appreciated!

    Module for calling Docker. Assumes `docker` is on the PATH.

    Contains two user-facing functions: dockerCall and dockerCheckOutput

    Uses Toil's defer functionality to ensure containers are shutdown even in case of job or pipeline failure

    Example of using dockerCall in a Toil pipeline to index a FASTA file with SAMtools:
        def toil_job(job):
            work_dir = job.fileStore.getLocalTempDir()
            path = job.fileStore.readGlobalFile(ref_id, os.path.join(work_dir, 'ref.fasta')
            parameters = ['faidx', path]
            dockerCall(job, tool='quay.io/ucgc_cgl/samtools:latest', work_dir=work_dir, parameters=parameters)

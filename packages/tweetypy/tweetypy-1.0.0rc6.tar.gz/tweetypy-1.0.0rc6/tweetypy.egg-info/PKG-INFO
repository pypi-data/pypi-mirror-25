Description: TweetyPy
        ========
        
        TweetyPy is a direct descendant of the FEX frequency excursion calculator.
        Frequency excursion is the first (and only in v1) analysis that TweetyPy is
        capable of, but there are plans for adding several additional calculations
        starting with trill rate and bandwidth followed by multi-song comparisons for
        similarity and eventually clustering and categorizations.
        
        The current code is still in an alpha state.  This means it should only be used
        for testing and cannot be considered reliable for analyses yet.  Please report
        any bugs, but do not be surprised if this_ happens while using the alpha/beta
        releases.

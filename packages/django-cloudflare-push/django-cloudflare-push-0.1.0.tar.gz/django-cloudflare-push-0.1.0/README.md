django-cloudflare-push
======================

About
-----

django-cloudflare-push is a small piece of middleware that looks at the list of
static files in each page that is requested (you need to be using some sort of
static files processor, like Django's built-in one), and [adds a Link
header](https://www.cloudflare.com/website-optimization/http2/serverpush/) that
CloudFlare uses to push the static files to the browser before the latter
requests them, using HTTP/2 Push.

Installing django-cloudflare-push
---------------------------------

* Install django-cloudflare-push using pip: `pip install django-cloudflare-push`

* Add the middleware to your MIDDLEWARE setting:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = (
    'django_cloudflare_push.middleware.push_middleware',
    ...
)
```

Done! Your static media will be pushed. You can test the middleware by looking
for the `Link` header.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBAutoArchive\fP is a simple utility to help create backups more easily.  The idea of the program is that all essential
information for creating a single backup\-\-\-such as list of directories that should be archived, the archive name,
etc.\-\-\-is stored in a single file \-\- the archive specification file\&.  It can use \fItar\fP(1) for creating archives, it
has a command line interface and supports incremental backups.
.sp
Archive specification files, also called ".aa files" are normally stored in a predefined location from where they are
processed by the \fBaa\fP command which results to creating of a corresponding backup for each.
.sp
Command \fBautoarchive\fP is alias for \fBaa\fP; these commands are equivalent.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
Most of the options can be specified also in \fIconfiguration files\fP and in the archive specification file (by using
the long option form and leaving out leading dashes) \-\- see \fIaa.conf\fP(5) and \fIaa_arch_spec\fP(5) for complete list of options that
can be specified there.  Command line options has higher priority than options in configuration files but lower
priority than the ones in the archive specification file.  \fB\-\-force\-*\fP options are available for the purpose of
overriding some of the options specified in the \&.aa file\&.
.sp
Boolean options can also have a negation form defined.  It has the "no\-" prefix before the option name.  For example:
\fB\-\-incremental\fP vs. \fB\-\-no\-incremental\fP\&.  The negation form has always higher priority than the normal form.
.sp
\fBList of command line options\fP

Commands for program\(aqs operations.  The default operation is the backup creation if no command is specified.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-list
Show all configured or orphaned archives\&.
.TP
.B \-\-purge
Purge stored data for an orphaned archive.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show program\(aqs version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-h\fP,\fB  \-\-help

\fBGeneral options:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v\fP,\fB  \-\-verbose
Turn on verbose output.
.TP
.B \-q\fP,\fB  \-\-quiet
Turn on quiet output.  Only errors will be shown.  If \fB\-\-quiet\fP is turned on at the same level as
\fB\-\-verbose\fP (e. g. both are specified on the command line) then \fB\-\-quiet\fP has higher priority than
\fB\-\-verbose\fP\&.
.TP
.B \-\-all
Operate on all configured archives\&. See also \fB\-\-archive\-specs\-dir\fP\&.
.TP
.BI \-\-archive\-specs\-dir\fB= DIR_PATH
Directory where archive specification files will be searched for (default:
~/.config/aa/archive_specs).
.TP
.BI \-\-user\-config\-file\fB= FILE_PATH
Alternate user configuration file (default: ~/.config/aa/aa.conf).
.TP
.BI \-\-user\-config\-dir\fB= DIR_PATH
Alternate user configuration directory (default: ~/.config/aa).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBArchiving options:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-a \ ARCHIVER\fP,\fB \ \-\-archiver\fB= ARCHIVER
Specify archiver type.  Supported types are: \(aqtar\(aq, \(aqtargz\(aq, \(aqtarbz2\(aq, \(aqtarxz\(aq, \(aqtar_internal\(aq,
\(aqtargz_internal\(aq, \(aqtarbz2_internal\(aq (default: targz).
.TP
.BI \-c \ NUM\fP,\fB \ \-\-compression\-level\fB= NUM
Compression strength level.  If not specified, default behaviour of underlying compression program will be used.
.TP
.BI \-d \ DIR_PATH\fP,\fB \ \-\-dest\-dir\fB= DIR_PATH
Directory where the backup will be created (default: <current directory>).
.TP
.B \-\-overwrite\-at\-start
If enabled, backups are overwritten at the start of creation.  If disabled (default), backups are overwritten
at the end of creation.  Enabling this option can be useful with big backups and low free space on the backup
volume.
.sp
Let\(aqs say \fBaa data\fP command will create backup /backups/data.tar.gz.  If a file with the same name already
exists in /backups then \-\- in case this option is enabled \-\- it will be overwritten as soon as creation of the
new backup starts.  If the option is not enabled the new backup will be first created under a temporary name
leaving the old backup untouched.  After the new backup is fully created it is renamed to /backups/data.tar.gz
overwriting the old one.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBIncremental archiving options:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i\fP,\fB  \-\-incremental
Perform incremental backup.
.TP
.BI \-l \ LEVEL\fP,\fB \ \-\-level\fB= LEVEL
Specify backup level which should be created.  All information about higher levels\-\-\-if any exists\-\-\-will be
erased.  If not present, the next level in a row will be created.
.TP
.B \-\-restarting
Turn on backup level restarting.  See other \fB*restart\-*\fP options to configure the restarting behaviour.
.TP
.BI \-\-restart\-after\-level\fB= LEVEL
Maximal backup level.  If reached, it will be restarted back to a lower level (which is typically level 1 but it
depends on \fB\-\-max\-restart\-level\-size\fP) (default: 10).
.TP
.BI \-\-restart\-after\-age\fB= DAYS
Number of days after which the backup level is restarted.  Similarly to \fB\-\-restart\-after\-level\fP it will be
restarted to level 1 or higher.
.TP
.BI \-\-full\-restart\-after\-count\fB= COUNT
Number of backup level restarts after which the level is restarted to 0.
.TP
.BI \-\-full\-restart\-after\-age\fB= DAYS
Number of days after which the backup level is restarted to 0.
.TP
.BI \-\-max\-restart\-level\-size\fB= PERCENTAGE
Maximal percentage size of a backup (of level > 0) to which level is allowed restart to.  The size is
percentage of size of the level 0 backup file.  If a backup of particular level has its size bigger than
defined percentage, restart to that level will not be allowed.
.TP
.B \-\-remove\-obsolete\-backups
Turn on removing backups of levels that are no longer valid due to the backup level restart.  All backups of
the backup level higher than the one currently being created will be removed.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBOptions for keeping old backups\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k\fP,\fB  \-\-keep\-old\-backups
Turn on backup keeping.  When a backup is about to be overwritten, it is renamed instead.  If \fB\-\-incremental\fP
is enabled it applies to all corresponding increments\&.  The new name is created by inserting a
keeping ID in front of backup file(s) extension.  The keeping ID is a string from interval \(aqaa\(aq, \(aqab\(aq, ...,
\(aqzy\(aq, \(aqzz\(aq where \(aqaa\(aq represents most recent kept backup.
.TP
.BI \-\-number\-of\-old\-backups\fB= NUM
Number of old backups to keep when \fB\-\-keep\-old\-backups\fP is enabled (default: 1).

\fIAA_SPEC\fP is the \fIarchive specification file argument\fP\&.  It determines the archive specification file that shall be
processed.  None, single or multiple \fIAA_SPEC\fP arguments are allowed.  If option \fB\-\-all\fP or command \fB\-\-list\fP is
specified then no \fIAA_SPEC\fP argument is required.  Otherwise at least single \fIAA_SPEC\fP argument is required.  If it
contains the ".aa" extension then it is taken as the path to an archive specification file.  Otherwise, if specified
without the extension, the corresponding \&.aa file is searched in the archive specifications directory\&.

.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Let\(aqs make a backup of configuration files of all users except the user "foo".  Let\(aqs assume that our system has
unix\-like style of home directories (directory "/home" contains directories of all users; configuration files begins
with dot).  Name of this backup will be "user\-configs".
.sp
First, we need to create the file "user\-configs.aa" under the "~/.config/aa/archive_specs/" directory \- this is the
archive specification file\&.  The file doesn\(aqt need to have the same name as the backup\&.  If it does however, the
option \fBname\fP can be left out (in this example we specified it anyway, even it is not needed).
.sp
In the \fBpath\fP variable we specify the archive root which is the \fBthe base directory which content we want to
backup\fP\&.
.sp
Variables \fBinclude\-files\fP and \fBexclude\-files\fP contains list of files and directories that we want to be included or
excluded respectively.  In this example we specify \fB*/.*\fP pattern because we want to include home directories of all
users (such as /home/\fBbob\fP, /home/\fBjoe\fP, etc.), what the first \fB*\fP is for.  And from within those user home
directories we want to include everything that begins with \fB\&.\fP (for example /home/bob/\fB\&.bashrc\fP), what the \fB\&.*\fP
pattern is for.  Paths specified in these variables are relative to \fBpath\fP\&.
.sp
Although, yet we do not want to include \fIall\fP user home directories as we specified in \fBinclude\-files\fP\&.  Those
directories that should not be included we put in \fBexclude\-files\fP ("foo" in this example, which makes /home/foo
excluded).  If we would not want to exclude any file then the corresponding variable would be specified as
\fBexclude\-files =\fP\&.
.sp
Content of the "user\-configs.aa" file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
# \-\-\-\-\-\- begin of user\-configs.aa \-\-\-\-\-\-
# AutoArchive\(aqs archive specification file for users configuration files
[Content]
name = user\-configs
path = /home
include\-files = */.*
exclude\-files = foo

[Archive]
dest\-dir = /mnt/backup
# \-\-\-\-\-\- end of user\-configs.aa \-\-\-\-\-\-
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Once we configured the archive we can create the backup easily with command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
and in the "/mnt/backup" directory the file "user\-configs.tar.gz" will be created.
.sp
Given the "user\-configs.aa" example file above, the command:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa \-i user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
will create \fBlevel 0\fP incremental backup \-\- "user\-configs.tar.gz" which is essentially the same as a
non\-incremental backup.  Another execution of the same command will create \fBlevel 1\fP backup named
"user\-configs.1.tar.gz" which contains only a differences from level 0.  Each subsequent call will create a \fBnext
level\fP which will contain only a differences from previous.
.sp
In order to restart to level 0 again, thus create a \fBfresh full backup\fP, the following command can be used:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa \-i \-l 0 user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that you \fBshould remove\fP all previously created "user\-configs" backups with level higher than 0
because they are no longer valid in regards to the newly created level 0 backup.  You may pass
\fB\-\-remove\-obsolete\-backups\fP option to the command above and they will be removed automatically.
.SS Backup Keeping
.sp
We assume that all previously created backups were removed in order to demonstrate the backup keeping.
.sp
First we create a standard backup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This creates "user\-configs.tar.gz" backup.  Some days later let\(aqs say, we want to create the same backup again.
However we do not want to overwrite the original one.  The option \fB\-k\fP can be used to keep the original backup:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa \-k user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will rename the original backup to "user\-configs.\fBaa\fP\&.tar.gz" and create the new one "user\-configs.tar.gz".
If we create the same backup for the third time (still using the \fB\-k\fP) option, "user\-configs.aa.tar.gz" will be
removed, "user\-configs.tar.gz" will be renamed to "user\-configs.aa.tar.gz" and the new "user\-configs.tar.gz" will be
created.  So AutoArchive by default keeps single old backup when \fB\-k\fP options is specified.  To keep more, e.g. four
backups we would specify \fB\-\-number\-of\-old\-backups=4\fP alongside with \fB\-k\fP\&.
.sp
Incremental backups can be kept as well.  Again, we assume that all previously created backups were removed.  Let\(aqs
create a few levels of incremental "user\-configs" archive:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa \-i \-l 0 user\-configs
aa \-i user\-configs
aa \-i user\-configs
aa \-i user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This will create following files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
user\-configs.tar.gz
user\-configs.1.tar.gz
user\-configs.2.tar.gz
user\-configs.3.tar.gz
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Then we (manually) restart to level 2 while asking to keep old backups:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
aa \-i \-l 2 \-k user\-configs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After this command following files will be present:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
user\-configs.tar.gz
user\-configs.1.tar.gz
user\-configs.2.tar.gz
user\-configs.2.aa.tar.gz
user\-configs.3.aa.tar.gz
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Let\(aqs explain what happened.  The original file "user\-configs.2.tar.gz" was going to be overwritten therefore it was
renamed to "user\-configs.2.aa.tar.gz".  As all backup levels higher than the renamed one depends on it they have to be
renamed as well.  In this example "user\-configs.3.tar.gz" depends on "user\-configs.2.tar.gz" therefore it was renamed
to "user\-configs.3.aa.tar.gz".  Finally the new increment "user\-configs.2.tar.gz" was created.

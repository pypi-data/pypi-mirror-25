[General]

# Turn on verbose output.  The higher the value is the more verbose output is
# selected.  Currently however, only 0 and 1 are recognized.
#verbose = 0

# Turn on quiet output.  Only errors will be shown.  If 'quiet' is turned on

# Archiving options
# -----------------

# Archiver type.  Supported types are: tar, targz, tarbz2, tarxz,
# tar_internal, targz_internal, tarbz2_internal.
#archiver = targz

# Compression strength level.  If not specified, default behaviour of
# underlying compression program will be used.
#compression-level =

# Directory where the backup will be created.
#dest-dir = .

# If enabled, backups are overwritten at the start of creation.  If disabled
# (default), backups are overwritten at the end of creation.  Enabling this
# option can be useful with big backups and low free space on the backup
# volume.
#overwrite-at-start = no



# Incremental archiving options
# -----------------------------

# Defines whether to perform incremental backup.
#incremental = no

# Defines whether to perform automatic backup level restarting.  See other
# '*restart-*' options to configure the restarting behaviour.
#restarting = no

# Maximal backup level.  If reached, it will be restarted back to a lower level
# (which is typically level 1 but it depends on 'max-restart-level-size')
#restart-after-level = 10

# Number of days after which the backup level is restarted.  Similarly to
# 'restart-after-level' it will be restarted to level 1 or higher.
#restart-after-age =

# Number of backup level restarts after which the level is restarted to 0.
#full-restart-after-count =

# Number of days after which the backup level is restarted to 0.
#full-restart-after-age =

# Maximal percentage size of a backup (of level > 0) to which level is
# allowed restart to.  The size is percentage of size of the level 0 archive
# file.  If a backup of particular level has its size bigger than defined
# percentage, restart to that level will not be allowed.
#max-restart-level-size =

# Turn on removing backups of levels that are no longer valid due to the
# backup level restart.  All backups of the backup level higher than the one
# currently being created will be removed.
#remove-obsolete-backups = no



# Options for keeping old backups
# -------------------------------

# Turn on backup keeping.  When a backup is about to be overwritten, it is
# renamed instead.  If 'incremental' is enabled it applies to all
# corresponding increments.  The new name is created by inserting a keeping ID
# in front of backup file(s) extension.  The keeping ID is a string from
# interval 'aa', 'ab', ..., 'zy', 'zz' where 'aa' represents most recent kept
# backup.
#keep-old-backups = no

# Number of old backups to keep when 'keep-old-backups' is enabled.
#number-of-old-backups = 1



# Command execution options
# -------------------------

# Arbitrary command that will be executed before backup creation for the set of
# selected archives.
#command-before-all-backups =

# Arbitrary command that will be executed after backup creation for the set of
# selected archives.
#command-after-all-backups =

# Arbitrary command to execute prior to each backup creation.
#command-before-backup =

# Arbitrary command to execute after each backup creation.
#command-after-backup =



# Force options
# -------------

# Force archiver type. Supported types are: tar, targz, tarbz2, tarxz,
# tar_internal, targz_internal, tarbz2_internal.
#force-archiver =

# Force incremental backup.
#force-incremental =

# Force backup level restarting.

# Force compression strength level.

# Force backup overwriting behavior.

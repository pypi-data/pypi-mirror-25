# AutoArchive's archive specification file for users configuration files

# This is an example file.  You might want to copy it to the /root directory
# and issue command "aa -i users-config" as root in order to create
# (incremental) backup of configuration files in users home directories.
# 
# Configuration files of the ftp user are excluded from the backup.

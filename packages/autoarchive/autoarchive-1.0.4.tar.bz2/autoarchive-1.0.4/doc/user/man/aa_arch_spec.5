.sp
\fB~/.config/aa/archive_specs/*.aa\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.sp
Options in the \&.aa file are divided into sections.  A section begins with the section name enclosed in square
brackets.  It contains variables which represents the options.
.sp
Variables are written in the \fBoption\-name = value\fP form, one variable per line.  Boolean values are written as
\fByes\fP and \fBno\fP\&.  For path values, tilde (\fB~\fP) is expanded to the user\(aqs home.  Form \fBoption\-name =\fP can be
used to specify a variable with undefined value.
.sp
Values of \fBinclude\-files\fP and \fBexclude\-files\fP options that contains spaces has to be enclosed in double quotes
(\fB""\fP).  They may contain standard shell wildcards.
.sp
When specifying the value it is possible to refer to other variables in the form \fB%(variable\-name)s\fP\&.
.sp
Lines beginning with \fB#\fP or \fB;\fP are ignored and may be used for comments.
.sp
Two sections are valid: \fB[Archive]\fP (optional) and \fB[Content]\fP\&.
.SS Section \fB[Archive]\fP

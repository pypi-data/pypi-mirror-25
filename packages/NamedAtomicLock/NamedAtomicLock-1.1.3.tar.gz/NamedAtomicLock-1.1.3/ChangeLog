1.1.3 - Oct 12 2017
- Add unit tests
- Better handle the case where a lock expires and another process acquires the expired lock, where version <= 1.1.2 both would think they held the lock. There is still some hairy-ness on reacquisition in this case, which will be handled in 1.2 (requires a design change)


1.1.2 - Oct 5 2017
- Fix isHeld method throwing exception when maxLockAge=None (the default)

1.1.1 - Jun 5 2017
- Update to note compatible with python 3.5 and python 3.6


1.1.0 - May 27 2016
- Add "isHeld" property to test if anyone holds the lock
- Don't raise FileNotFoundError in the rare case that the lock is removed
between call to os.path.exists  and os.stat

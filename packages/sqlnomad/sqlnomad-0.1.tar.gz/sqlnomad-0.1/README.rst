Monadic wrapper around SQL syntax


Description
===========

SQL is verbose, and the differences between SQL dialects make migration between databases tedious.  This project aims to solve both issues by abstracting SQL syntax into a series of subquery primitives and providing monadic functions to transform them.


Note
====

This project is in its infancy.  The API will be subject to drastic changes up until its 1.0 release.

        ===========
        
        Generic http upload tool.
        
        If the http upload was successfull, files get moved to a "done" sub directory.
        
        Handles pairs of files.
        
        For example you have for files: a.pdf, a.xml, b.pdf, b.xml
        
        The first upload should take a.pdf and a.xml, and the second upload b.pdf and b.xml.
        
        The upload is considered successfull by tbzuploader if the servers replies with http status `201 Created <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#2xx_Success>`_

Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        This library packages `select2`_ for `fanstatic`_.
        
        .. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
        .. _`select2`: https://select2.github.io/
        
        This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
        and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
        directory in ``js.select2``) are published to some URL.
        
        How to use?
        ===========
        
        
        You can import ``select2`` from ``js.select2`` and ``need`` it where you want
        these resources to be included on a page::
        
          >>> from js.select2 import select2
          >>> select2.need()
        
        To use the full build use::
        
          >>> from js.select2 import select2_full
          >>> select2_full.need()

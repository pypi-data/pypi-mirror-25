Description: TRI Coding Challenge Parser
        ==========================
        
        Parser Instructions
        ----------------------
        To run parser, `python3 run_parser.py`.
        Enter the path of your file `Enter the absolute path of input file:`
        Enter the x-largest `Enter value for X-largest:`
        
        Algorithmic Complexity
        ----------------------
        - The parser reads in the document file line by line.
        - O(n) * [file I/O]
        - Note: scan_document(file_path) is modular to be replaced with more optimal scanning performane.
        - An example of faster scanning solution: read file in chunks(1024) or chunks depending on size of file.
        - The parser keeps the parsed data in a max-Heap.
        - Returning the x-largest values from the max-Heap (delete-max) is O(log n).
        - The space complexity of a heap is O(n).
        
        Unit Test Suite
        ----------------------
        To run unit tests `python3 setup.py test`
        
        Hours Spent
        ----------------------
        - I took 1-2 hours to write the parser, 2-4 hours on trying different unit test tools and structure.

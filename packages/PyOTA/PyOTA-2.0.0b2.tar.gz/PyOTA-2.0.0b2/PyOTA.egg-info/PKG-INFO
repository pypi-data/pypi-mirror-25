        This is the official Python library for the IOTA Core.
        
        It implements both the `official API`_, as well as newly-proposed functionality
        (such as signing, bundles, utilities and conversion).

        Optional C Extension
        ====================
        PyOTA has an optional C extension that improves the performance of its
        cryptography features significantly (speedups of **60x** are common!).
        
        To install this extension, use the following command::
        
           pip install --pre pyota[ccurl]

        1. `Create virtualenv`_ (recommended, but not required).
        2. ``git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.lib.py.git``
        3. ``pip install -e .``

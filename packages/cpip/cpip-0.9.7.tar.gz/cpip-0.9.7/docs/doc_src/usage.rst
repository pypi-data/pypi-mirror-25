To use cpip in a project::

    import cpip

Have a read of the :ref:`cpip.tutorial` for how you can use CPIP programatically. In there is a tutorial on how to use the ``PpLexer`` that is the equivalent of ``cpp``: :ref:`cpip.tutorial.PpLexer`. There is also the :ref:`cpip.tutorial.FileIncludeGraph` showing how you can analyse how ``#include``'d files are processed. This is very useful for undestanding file dependencies.

        =========
        
        A codemod that will hoist prop types and default props to the top of the file.  Currently only
        works with files with one component.
        
        Install
        -----------
        ```
        pip install hoist-prop-types
        ```
        
        Usage
        ----------
        ```
        hoist-prop-types ./my/dir/
        ```
        
        This will read all `.js` and `.jsx` files and try to hoist the prop types to the top.

===========

photovoltaic provides basic function used in photovoltaics. You might find
it most useful for coding photovoltaic simulations. Typical usage:

    import photovoltaic as pv

    irradiance = pv.blackbody_spectrum(6000)
    print(irradiance)

This would print the blackbody irradiance in W/m2/nm

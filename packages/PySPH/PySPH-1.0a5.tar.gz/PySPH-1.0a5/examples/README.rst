The important examples are shipped along with the PySPH sources and can
be run by typing::

    $ python -m pysph.examples.run

If you know of the particular example to run you can also directly run
it as::

    $ python -m pysph.examples.elliptical_drop

The examples in this directory are just sample examples or are scripts
that do not entirely work correctly.

OmNomNom
========

OmNomNom is a Telegram bot that can tell you what you can eat in some
canteens in Berlin (Germany). I would like to support more canteens in
other towns or countries in the future. If you have any suggestions let
me now. You can invite the bot to a group or ask it directly.

How to use it
-------------

Usually you do not need to run the bot yourself. You can just talk to
the @OmnBot in Telegram. Feel free to invite it to your groups.

Developer & Maintainer
----------------------

-  Max Rosin

Contributer
-----------

Thanks to everyone who contributed code or documentation improvements to
the bot.

-  Christian Beneke
-  Matthias Loibl

If you want to add canteens or features to the bot or want to fix some
bug feel free to open a GitHub issue and start hacking :-) Pull Requests
are very wellcome! If you found some problem or would like to see a new
feature or more canteens but are not able (or do not want to / do not
have the time) please also open an issue at GitHub and/or talk to me via
Telegram (@ekeih).

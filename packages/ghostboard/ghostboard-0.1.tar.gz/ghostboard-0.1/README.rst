Ghostboard
==========

You start it up with a file and it will record any text you copy to the
system clipboard and write it to the file.

Why?
----

Believe it or not, I needed to download a whole bunch of files on a web
page, and each link was a button, and I wanted a quick way to
right-click, copy, and put them in a text file so wget could download
them, 20 minutes later, here we are.

Usage
-----

::

    $ ghostboard /path/to/file

That's it.

Installation
------------

Use pip with the url:

::

    $ pip install --upgrade "git+https://github.com/Jaymon/ghostboard#egg=ghostboard"

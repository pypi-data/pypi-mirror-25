If you see this message, compilation and installation unfortunately failed.
The esig package requires the Boost C++ library to be installed and correctly configured.
Installation most likely failed because the installer was not able to locate Boost.

Please make sure you have done the following.
	* Downloaded and installed a copy of Boost.
	  How you do this varies from platform to platorm.
	  Check out http://xxx.yyy for more information on how to do this.
	* Provided the necessary paths to Boost include files and libraries.
	  This is only necessary when installing Boost to a non-standard location.
	  If you do this, you can use the --include-paths and --library-paths arguments.

Once you have done this, esig should install successfully.
For more information, you can refer to the online documentation at http://xxx.yyy.

# MMeowlink

MMeowlink acts as an OpenAPS driver. It allows you to replace the CareLink
USB device with a variety of radio transmitter sticks.

This is based on the hard work done by Ben West for the [mmblelink](https://github.com/bewest/mmblelink)
project and Pete Schwamb for [subg_rfspy](https://github.com/ps2/subg_rfspy)

==================================
MIGRATIONS from 0.10.x to 0.11.x :
==================================

Nota : in the SQL queries below, I use CURRENT_TIMESTAMP because of Postgresql. Adapt it to your own RDBMS.

Django Trigger Happy tables :
=============================

To migrate enter, 

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py  migrate

if the migration complains  that you've already created the table django_th_rss then check the follow :

.. code-block:: sql
    
    select * from django_migrations ;

to find 

    11 | django_th         | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02

if you dont have it then do :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('django_th','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


then replay 

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate



Django Trigger Happy Module tables :
====================================

Evernote :

    select * from django_migrations ;

    13 | th_evernote       | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02 


if its not the case, then add the following by hand like that :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_evernote','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


Holidays :
----------

if the migration complains that you've already created the table django_th_holidays then check it by :

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from django_migrations ;


check that you dont have those record in the django_migrations table

.. code-block:: sql
    
    select * from django_migrations ;

    13 | th_holidays       | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02 

if its not the case, then add the following by hand like that :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_holidays','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

    13 | th_pocket       | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02 

if its not the case, then add the following by hand like that :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_pocket','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


Readability :
-------------

if the migration complains that you've already created the table django_th_readability then check it by :

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from django_migrations ;


check that you dont have those record in the django_migrations table

.. code-block:: sql
    
    select * from django_migrations ;

    13 | th_readability  | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02 


if its not the case, then add the following by hand like that :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_readability','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


Twitter :
---------

if the migration complains that you've already created the table django_th_twitter then check it by :

.. code-block:: sql

    select * from django_migrations ;


check that you dont have those record in the django_migrations table

.. code-block:: sql
    
    select * from django_migrations ;

    13 | th_twitter     | 0001_initial        | 2015-06-10 10:00:00.977958+02 


if its not the case, then add the following by hand like that :

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_twitter','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_twitter','0002_int_to_bigint',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

before adding by hand the line below, check that the table django_th_twitter contains the column max_id and since_id as bigint and not just int

if that columns are not bigint add just this

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_twitter','0001_initial',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


otherwise add this too

.. code-block:: sql

    insert into django_migrations (app,name,applied) values('th_twitter','0002_int_to_bigint',CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);


Table to drop :
---------------

with the last 

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate


you will meet this message :


.. code-block:: bash

    Running migrations:
      No migrations to apply.
      Your models have changes that are not yet reflected in a migration, and so won't be applied.
      Run 'manage.py makemigrations' to make new migrations, and then re-run 'manage.py migrate' to apply them.
    The following content types are stale and need to be deleted:

        django_th | userprofile

answer yes as this one is not used at all


then play again

.. code-block:: bash

    python manage.py migrate

thus the migration will skip that steps and will continue smoothly

Nix(OS) vulnerability scanner
=============================

This is a utility that validates a Nix store for any packages that are
reachable from live paths and likely to be affected by vulnerabilities
listed in the NVD.

It implements a CLI utility to inspect the current status and a
monitoring integration for Sensu.

Example output:

::

    Security issues for sqlite, libxml2, ... (and 10 more)

    sqlite-2.9.3 (inprogress)
        https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2016-2073
        https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8710

        See https://plan.flyingcircus.io/issues/18544


    libxml2-2.9.3
        https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3717


System requirements
-------------------

- Depends on common Nix tools like `nix-store`. These are expected to be in
  $PATH.
- Depends on being able to interact with the Nix store database
  (/nix/var/nix/db). This means that it must either run as the same user that
  owns the Nix store database or `nix-daemon` must be active.
- It refuses to work without some locale environment settings. Try `export
  LANG=C.UTF-8` if you see encoding errors.


Whitelist
=========

The whitelist file uses a sub-set of the
`YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__ language to define rules
which matches shall be ignored or in other words are declared to be
trusted or in progress, hence the term whitelist. If the match is
**partial**, e.G. there is a package which is affected by more than one
vulnerability, but only one is whitelist, the match will still be
printed except for the declared exception.

Syntax
------

Every rule starts with the ``-`` and a new-line, declaring a list
element.

Example
-------

There is an `example`_ for a
working whitelist file as part of the unit tests.

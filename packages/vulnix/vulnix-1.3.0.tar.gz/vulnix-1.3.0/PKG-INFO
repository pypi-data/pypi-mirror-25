Description: Nix(OS) vulnerability scanner
        =============================
        
        This is a utility that validates a Nix store for any packages that are
        reachable from live paths and likely to be affected by vulnerabilities
        listed in the NVD.
        
        It implements a CLI utility to inspect the current status and a
        monitoring integration for Sensu.
        
        Example output:
        
        ::
        
            Security issues for sqlite, libxml2, ... (and 10 more)
        
            sqlite-2.9.3 (inprogress)

                https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-8710
        
                See https://plan.flyingcircus.io/issues/18544
        
        
            libxml2-2.9.3
                https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2015-3717
        
        
        System requirements
        -------------------
        
        - Depends on common Nix tools like `nix-store`. These are expected to be in
          $PATH.
        - Depends on being able to interact with the Nix store database
          (/nix/var/nix/db). This means that it must either run as the same user that
          owns the Nix store database or `nix-daemon` must be active.
        - It refuses to work without some locale environment settings. Try `export
          LANG=C.UTF-8` if you see encoding errors.
        
        
        Whitelist
        =========
        
        The whitelist file uses a sub-set of the
        `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`__ language to define rules
        which matches shall be ignored or in other words are declared to be
        trusted or in progress, hence the term whitelist. If the match is
        **partial**, e.G. there is a package which is affected by more than one
        vulnerability, but only one is whitelist, the match will still be
        printed except for the declared exception.
        
        Syntax
        ------
        
        Every rule starts with the ``-`` and a new-line, declaring a list
        element.

        Hacking
        =======
        
        To create a development environment, use a Python 3 virtualenv::
        
            pyvenv-3.5 .
            bin/pip install -e .\[test]
        
        Run tests::
        
            bin/py.test
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        1.3.0 (2017-09-18)
        ------------------
        
        - `.drv` files may be specified directly on the command line.
        - Updated PyPI dependencies.
        - Document system requirements (#12).
        - Don't leave large files in /tmp around.
        - Remove duplicate CVEs in output (#25).
        - Fix bug with reporting less than 3 vulnerabilities (#28).
        
        
        1.2.2 (2017-01-28)
        ------------------
        
        - Packaging improvements: pin versions in setup.py, include NVDCVE test data in
          sdist.
        - Reduce NVDCVE fixture size. This cuts tests run time by more than 50%.
        
        
        1.2.1 (2017-01-27)
        ------------------
        
        - Skip `/nix/var/nix/gcroots/booted-system` during system check.
        - Make output a bit easier to read by removing visual clutter.
        
        
        1.2 (2016-12-22)
        ----------------
        
        - Improve CPU and memory usage: refactored the way we fetch, parse, store and
          process data. We now leverage ZODB as the storage for parsed data that is
          efficient to look up.
        
          On our test systems this caused memory usage to drop from > 1GiB to ~70MiB
          and a pure evaluation of existing data to around 7-10 seconds.
        
          This change requires a re-retrieval of all historic sources.
        
        - Improve unit test coverage with at least a smoke test for our new fetching
          procedure.
        
        1.1.5 (2016-10-13)
        ------------------
        
        - Keep a reverse index: product name -> vulnerabilities to speed up scan process.
        - Mark 'in progress' vulnerabilities with an asterisk
        - The '-w' switch accepts URLs, too
        - vulnix no longer scans /var/nix/var/gcroots/booted-system
        - only cached files are saved (archives are to be deleted)
        - added travis build: runs periodically against nixpkgs/master and updates
          requirements*.nix files in case of success
        
        
        1.1.4 (2016-08-25)
        ------------------
        
        - Add `src` to PYTHONPATH so that tests run also on older NixOS versions
          (tested on 15.09).
        - Correct URL, add metadata.
        - Add nix to propagatedBuildInputs, as vulnix calls `nix-store` at runtime.
        
        
        1.1.3 (2016-08-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Pin the Python version to 3.4 (Nix only)
        
        
        1.1.2 (2016-08-15)
        ------------------
        
        - Add Nix expressions (Nix/NixOS) to MANIFEST.in
        
        
        1.1.1 (2016-08-12)
        ------------------
        
        - Add VERSION to MANIFEST.in
        
        
        1.1 (2016-08-11)
        ----------------
        
        - Scans the whole system (NixOS only), the current user environment, or a
          project-specific path (e.g., ./result). #1
        
        - Allow to specify site-specific whitelists in addition to the builtin default
          whitelist. #4
        
        - Fully repeatable install using default.nix. Thanks to Rok Garbas. #4
        
        - Cache pre-parsed NVD files for improved scanning speed. #2
        
        - Support multiple whitelists (repeat -w option). #3
        
        - Cache NVD files in `~/.cache/vulnix`. #7
        
        - Document whitelist file format. #10
        
        - Fix Nix build on macOS. #11

Description: MiniDLNA Indicator
        ==================
        
        |Code Health| |PyPI|
        
        This indicator allows you to launch an instance of
        `MiniDLNA <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MiniDLNA>`__ as a normal
        user, without the need to edit configuration files as ``root``, or
        restart by command the application if you have changed the
        configuration.
        
        Some of the features this indicator provides are:
        
        -  Detect if the process has died, using a background thread
        -  Auto generation of a port and uuid to avoid conflicts with the
           default configuration (`check
           this <https://spremi.wordpress.com/2014/06/30/minidlna-multiple-instances/>`__
           to know the problem about uuid)
        -  Auto configuration when first run (adding the pictures, music, videos
           and downloads folder of the user, if the exist, and generating a
           random, non-default, port)
        
        Tested operating systems:
        
        -  `Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus) <http://www.ubuntu.com>`__
        -  `Linux Mint 17.3 (Rosa) <https://www.linuxmint.com>`__
        -  `Fedora 26 <https://getfedora.org>`__ (with the
           `KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator
           Support <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/>`__
           Gnome Shell extension)
        
        It should work with any operating system that supports Python 3.5+,
        AppIndicator and the required dependencies. If you have problems,
        please, open an issue.
        
        Tested from these devices (tests from more devices are welcome):
        
        -  `Samsung UE32F5500
           TV <http://www.samsung.com/nl/consumer/tv-audio-video/televisions/led-tv/UE32F5500AWXXN>`__
        -  `Android
           BubbleUPnP <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bubblesoft.android.bubbleupnp>`__
        
        What is MiniDLNA?
        -----------------
        
        In brief, MiniDLNA is a small program that allows you to share
        multimedia content (audio, video, pictures, etc.) easily with
        `DLNA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance>`__/`UPnP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play>`__
        compatible devices (for example, smart TVs, phones, XBMC, etc.). This
        also could be done with some type of share services, like
        Windows/Samba/CIFS, NFS, etc. but DLNA is easier to configure (you just
        need to run the program and select the folders you want to share); it is
        faster, no need to configure security.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        You will need this software to run the indicator, considering a standard
        initial installation of Ubuntu/Mint:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo apt install minidlna python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-gi python3-psutil
        
        For Fedora, you will need `RPM Fusion <https://rpmfusion.org/>`__
        repository:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo dnf install https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
        
        And then install these dependencies:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo dnf install minidlna python3-setuptools python3-pip python3-gobject python3-psutil libappindicator-gtk3
        
        Also remember to install the `KStatusNotifierItem/AppIndicator
        Support <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/>`__
        Gnome Shell extension from the web or using these commands:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            sudo dnf install chrome-gnome-shell gnome-tweak-tool jq
            curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okelet/minidlnaindicator/master/gnome-ext-install.md | bash -s -- install appindicatorsupport@rgcjonas.gmail.com
        
        Instalation/Uppgrade
        --------------------
        
        No ``deb`` or ``rpm`` packages available; only from PyPi; if someone
        wants to contribute, it will be welcome.
        
        ::
        
            python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade minidlnaindicator
        
        ``pip`` will create a shortcut in the applications menu.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        The configuration is very basic. It will detect an existing user
        configuration in the ``~/.minidlna/minidlna.conf`` file, check it, and
        use it. If it doesn't exist, it will generate a new one with the user
        images, music, videos and downloads folder of the current user.
        
        The default application configuration, will launch the MiniDLNA process
        when the indicator starts, and it will be stopped when the indicator
        finishes. Also, the own indicator will configure itself to run on every
        user logon. All these 3 settings can be changed from the indicator
        configuration menu.
        
        The MiniDLNA configuration has to be done by hand, but there are some
        shortcuts to open the file and edit it. You can also open from the menu
        the LOG. If you change the configuration, please remember to restart the
        MiniDLNA process.

        License
        =======
        
        I don't know. This is a very small program done for myself and published
        just to help other people with the same problems.
        
        In brief, this is my idea. You can use the program freely; you don't
        have to pay me or somebody anything. You can modify it, and redistribute
        it, as long as you keep this "license", attach the base source code, and
        mention the original author (me).
        
        Anyway, I wish (but this is not mandatory, as long as you accomplish the
        previous sentence) there weren't lots of forks spread over Internet, so,
        I would prefer if you have fixes or new features, do a pull request;
        this is something just to have the code centralized and ordered; I hate
        when I search a program or library and there are lots of forks, each one
        with different fixes or features.
        
        Additionaly, as I do, you can't sell this program or get any economic
        benefit of it.
        
        If you like the program, you can send a bottle of good wine (I don't
        like beer ðŸ˜Š).
        
        Fixes or suggestions about this "license" are welcome.
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        -  Translators needed
        -  Detect external MiniDLNA configuration changes
        -  Allow some basic MiniDLNA configuration (media folders, port)

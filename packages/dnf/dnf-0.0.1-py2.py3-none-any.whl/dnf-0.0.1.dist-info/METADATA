pypi-dnf
========

Placeholder package to make the DNF Python API available through PyPI.

A number of DNF's dependencies (notable libdnf and libsolv) are
currently only available as part of Linux distro packages.

Right now, this package just reserves the ``dnf`` name on PyPI to avoid
the potential for a name conflict with the ``python3-dnf`` packages on
Linux distros using DNF for RPM dependency management.

However, I eventually hope to replace it with a CMake-dependent PEP 517
backend that runs the full libdnf build process, and then emits a
statically linked completely self-contained extension module as part of
a wheel file (together with the pure Python components of the DNF Python
API).

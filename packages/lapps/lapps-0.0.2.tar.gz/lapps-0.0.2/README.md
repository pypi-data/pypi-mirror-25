# The Language Applications Grid Python API

The [Language Appications Grid](http://www.lappsgrid.org) (LAPPS Grid) provides a framework for interoperable NLP (Natural Language Procssessing) web services.

The Python API resembles the [Java API](http://github.com/lapps) with some exceptions:

1. The Python API follows Python naming conventions.  For example in the Java API we have `Serializer.toJson(object)` and in Python we have `Serializer.to_json(object)`
1. Only the client portion of the Java API has been implemented. That is, there is no support for writing a LAPPS Soap service in Python.

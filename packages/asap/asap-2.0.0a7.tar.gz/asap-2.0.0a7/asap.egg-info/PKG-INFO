Description: ASAP - Answer Set Application Programming
        =========================================
        
        Running examples
        ----------------
        
        * ./bin/asap-example-onoffswitch
        
          This is the most simple example of a switch.
        
        * ./bin/asap-tetris
        
          This example is the game Tetris, including a player
          name, increasing difficulty with increasing score,
          and a high score list.
        
        * ./bin/asap-aplagent
        
          This example is an interactive action plan inspector
          that works with domain and action description files
          from APLAgent that can be obtained from
          http://mbal.tk/APLAgentMgr/ and is distributed
          under GPL license.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        * If you do not have it: install `pip3`: for example under Ubuntu via
            
            ```$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip```
        
        * Install ASAP with pip3, see PyPi repository at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asap
        
            ```$ pip3 install asap --user```
        
        * Setup Python to use the "Userinstall" environment that allows you to install Python programs without overwriting system packages. This is achieved by adding the following to your `.profile` or `.bashrc` file:
        
            export PYTHONUSERBASE=~/.local/
            export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
        
        * Run ASAP the first time. This will help to download and build pyclingo if you do not have pyclingo for Python 3 already usable via `import clingo`:
        
            ```$ asap```
        
            The first run of asap might ask you to enter the sudo password
            to install several packages.
            (If you do not want to enter your sudo password: abort, install the packages manually, and later run `asap` again.)
        
          * Ubuntu 16.04 is tested
          * Debian 8.6 (jessie) is tested
          * Ubuntu 14.04 can not work without manual installation of cmake 3.1 or higher (for buildling clingo)
        
        Running `asap`
        --------------
        
        * cat <program> |./bin/asap <arguments>

Description: jk_fileaccess
        =============
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This python module provides a uniform interface to process files that are either stored locally or remotely.
        
        **What this uniform interface is:** A simple way to iterate over a (very) large set of files. This should
        be fast, this should be simple. That is the goal this module tries to achieve.
        
        **What this uniform interface not is:** A full featured file system API. The classes are quite limited.
        (Nevertheless feel free to aid in development of this module to extend the functionality of these classes.)

        **Bitmask** is the client for the services offered by `the LEAP Platform`_. It
        contains a command-line interface and a multiplatform desktop client. It can be
        also used as a set of libraries to communicate with the different services from
        third party applications.
        
        It is written in python using `Twisted`_  and licensed under the `GPL3`_. The
        Graphical User Interface is written in html+js and uses `PyQt5`_ for serving
        the application.

        Package under development!
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        The previous client using PySide has been deprecated (Bitmask version 0.9.2,
        still available at the http://github.com/leapcode/bitmask_client repo).
        
        
        Read the Docs!
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        There is documentation about Bitmask `for users`_ and `for developers`_.

        Logs
        ----
        
        If you want to watch the logs, from the command line::
        
          bitmaskctl logs watch
        
        The paste command can be handy to do bug reports (needs ``pastebinit`` installed
        in the system)::
        
          bitmaskctl logs send
        
        
        Development
        ===========================================================
        
        Running Tests
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        You need tox to run the tests. If you don't have it in your system yet::
        
          pip install tox
        
        And then run all the python tests::
        
          tox
        
        There are some minimal end-to-end tests::
        
          make test_e2e
        
        For testing the UI (aka ``bitmask-js``) you need to have ``mocha``
        installed. You can run ui tests like this::
        
          cd ui && make test
        
        
        Hacking
        -----------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to run bitmask in a development environment, you must activate a
        virtualenv and install the various packages using 'pip install -e'. This
        installs python packages as links to the source code, so that your code
        changes are immediately reflected in the packages installed in the
        virtualenv.
        
        The various ``make dev-*`` commands will run the appropriate ``pip install``
        commands for you.
        
        If you want to setup your whole development environment, and you are running a
        debian-based system, you can try::
        
          make dev-bootstrap
        
        To upgrade regularly the python dependencies installed inside your virtualenv,
        you can run::
        
          make upgrade-all
        
        inside your virtualenv, and it will install any new version of your
        dependencies that is found in pypi.
        
        
        Run headless backend in development mode
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        Prerequisites::
        
          sudo apt install build-essential python-dev python-virtualenv \
                           libsqlcipher-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev
        
        Install and activate a virtualenv::
        
          cd bitmask-dev
          virtualenv venv
          source venv/bin/activate
        
        (Refer to the `virtualenv documentation` if you're not using bash/zsh/dash).
        
        All the subsequent commands assume that you have activated the virtualenv.
        
        Install all the python dependencies::
        
          make dev-backend
        
        Run application::
        
          bitmaskd
        
        .. _`virtualenv documentation`: https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/userguide/#activate-script
        
        Run user interface frontend
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        If you want to run the Bitmask user interface, you additionally need the
        following:
        
        Prerequisites::
        
          sudo apt install python-pyqt5  python-pyqt5.qtwebkit
        
        Install python dependencies::
        
          make dev-all
        
        Note: even though the UI is in javascript, Qt is used to create a webview
        window.
        
        Run user interface::
        
          bitmask
        
        The command `bitmask` should be in your path if you have activated the virtual
        environment.
        
        Install Bitmask user interface in development mode
        +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
        
        The above instructions will install a python package that contains a pre-
        bundled version of the javascript UI.
        
        If you want to modify the javascript UI, then you need to be able to update the
        javascript bundle whenever a javascript or CSS source file changes. To support
        this, we build a python package of the javascript UI and install it in
        "development mode" so that changes to the contents of the package are reflected
        in bitmaskd immediately.
        
        Prerequisites::
        
          sudo apt install nodejs npm nodejs-legacy
        
        Next, run ``dev-install``::
        
          cd ui
          make dev-install
        
        Now you should be able to run the user interface with debugging tools::
        
          bitmaskd
          cd ui
          npm run ui
        
        This command is the same as running::
        
          chromium-browser "http://localhost:7070/#$(cat ~/.config/leap/authtoken)"
        
        Firefox does not work as well, because the UI is only tested with webkit-based
        browsers.
        
        Chromium is not the most ideal, however, because it uses a newer webkit than is
        available in Qt. Instead, try qupzilla::
        
          sudo apt install qupzilla
          bitmaskd
          qupzilla -ow "http://localhost:7070/#$(cat ~/.config/leap/authtoken)"
        
        If you make a change to any of the CSS or JS source files, you need to rebuild
        the javascript bundle. You can do this continually as files change like so::
        
          cd ui
          node run watch
        
        The new javascript bundle will be used when you refresh the page so long as
        ``make dev-install`` was previously run.
        
        For more information, see ``ui/README.md``.

Description: # LEL Interpreter in Python
        
        Lel is a lisp like programming language. It is not meant for practical purposes, but more as a tool to learn how to write a programming language.
        
        This project comes with a Lel interpreter for running Lel programs, and a REPL for executing Lel expressions in real time.
        
        The pylel version is developed in Python.
        
        # Installation
        
        If you would like to install the interpreter and REPL to your machines
        
        ```
        pip install lel-lang
        ```
        
        # Usage 
        
        To use the REPL, simply call 
        
        ```
        pylel
        ``` 
        
        or you can feed a lel file to the same command to run the code. 
        
        ```
        pylel filename.lel
        ``` 
        
        # Acknowledgement
        
        The first version of the language syntax and javaScript implementation is written by Frank Stokes.

Description: LEL Interpreter
        =======================
        
        Lel is a lisp like programming language. It is not meant for practical purposes, but more as a tool to learn how to write a programming language.
        
        This project comes with a Lel interpreter for running Lel programs, and a REPL for executing Lel expressions in real time.

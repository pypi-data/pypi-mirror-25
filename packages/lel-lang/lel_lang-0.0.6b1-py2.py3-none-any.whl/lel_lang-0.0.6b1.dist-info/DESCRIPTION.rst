# LEL Interpreter in Python

Lel is a lisp like programming language. It is not meant for practical purposes, but more as a tool to learn how to write a programming language.

This project comes with a Lel interpreter for running Lel programs, and a REPL for executing Lel expressions in real time.

The pylel version is developed in Python.

# Installation

If you would like to install the interpreter and REPL to your machines

```
pip install lel-lang
```

# Usage 

To use the REPL, simply call 

```
pylel
``` 

or you can feed a lel file to the same command to run the code. 

```
pylel filename.lel
``` 

# Acknowledgement

The first version of the language syntax and javaScript implementation is written by Frank Stokes.

"""Definition of simulation objects for Monte Carlo simulations.

This module defines some classes and functions for performing
Monte Carlo simulations.

Important classes defined here

UmbrellaWindowSimulation (:py:class:`.UmbrellaWindowSimulation`)
    Defines a simulation for performing umbrella window simulations.

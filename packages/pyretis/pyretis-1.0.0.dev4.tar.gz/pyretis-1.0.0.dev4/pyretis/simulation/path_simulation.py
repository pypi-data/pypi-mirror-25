    Attributes
    ----------
    engine : object like :py:class:`.EngineBase`
        This is the integrator that is used to propagate the system
        in time.
    path_ensembles : list of objects like :py:class:`.PathEnsemble`
        This is used for storing results for the different path
        ensembles.
    rgen : object like :py:class:`.RandomGenerator`
        This is a random generator used for the generation of paths.
    system : object like :py:class:`.System`
        This is the system the simulation will act on.
    settings : dict
        A dictionary with TIS and RETIS settings. We expect that
        we can find ``settings['tis']`` and possibly
        ``settings['retis']``. For ``settings['tis']`` we further
        expect to find the keys:

        * `aimless`: Determines if we should do aimless shooting
          (True) or not (False).
        * `sigma_v`: Scale used for non-aimless shooting.
        * `seed`: A integer seed for the random generator used for
          the path ensemble we are simulating here.

        Note that the
        :py:meth:`pyretis.core.tis.make_tis_step_ensemble` method
        will make use of additional keys from ``settings['tis']``.
        Please see this method for further details. For the
        ``settings['retis']`` we expect to find the following keys:

        * `swapfreq`: The frequency for swapping moves.
        * `relative_shoots`: If we should do relative shooting for
          the ensembles.
        * `nullmoves`: Should we perform null moves.
        * `swapsimul`: Should we just swap a single pair or several
          pairs.
    required_settings : tuple of strings
        This is just a list of the settings that the simulation
        requires. Here it is used as a check to see that we have
        all we need to set up the simulation.

    cycle : dict of integers
        This dictionary stores information about the number of cycles.
        The keywords are:

        * `end`: Represents the cycle number where the simulation
          should end.
        * `step`: The current cycle number.
        * `start`: The cycle number we started at.
        * `stepno`: The number of cycles we have performed to arrive at
          cycle number given by `cycle['step']`.

        Note that `cycle['stepno']` might be different from
        `cycle['step']` since `cycle['start']` might be != 0.
    task : list of objects like :py:class:`.SimulationTask`

        Parameters
        ----------
        task : dict
            A dict defining the task. A task is represented by a

            and when to execute the task. Note that the actual
            execution of the task in controlled in the object.
            The keywords are:

            * `func`: A function to execute.
            * `args` which stores the arguments for the function.
            * `kwargs` which store the keyword arguments for the
              function.
            * `when` which stores when the task should be executed.
            * `first` which is a boolean which determines if the task
              should be executed on the initial step, i.e. before the
              full simulation starts.
            * `result` which is used to label the result. This is used
              for output.
        position : int
            Can be used to placed the task at a specific position.

        `SimulationTask` will do some tests on the consistency of the
        keys 'func', 'args' and 'kwargs'. If this is not consistent,

Description: # WaiverDB
        
        WaiverDB is a companion service to 
        [ResultsDB](https://pagure.io/taskotron/resultsdb), for recording waivers 
        against test results.
        
        ## Quick development setup
        
        Install dependencies:
        
            $ sudo dnf builddep waiverdb.spec
        
        Run the server:
        
            $ python run-dev-server.py
        
        The server is now running at <http://localhost:5004> and API calls can be sent to
        <http://localhost:5004/api/v1.0>. All data is stored inside `/var/tmp/waiverdb_db.sqlite`.
        
        ## Adjusting configuration
        
        You can configure this app by copying `conf/settings.py.example` into
        `conf/setting.py` and adjusting values as you see fit. It overrides default
        values in `waiverdb/config.py`.
        
        ## Running test suite
        
        You can run this test suite with the following command::
        
            $ py.test tests/
        
        To test against all supported versions of Python, you can use tox::
        
            $ sudo dnf install python3-tox
            $ tox
        
        ## Building the docs
        
        You can view the docs locally with::
        
            $ cd docs
            $ make html
            $ firefox _build/html/index.html
        
        ## Viewing published fedmsgs
        
        You can view fedmsgs published when new waivers get created by doing::
        
            $ fedmsg-relay --config-filename fedmsg.d/config.py &
            $ fedmsg-tail --config fedmsg.d/config.py --no-validate --really-pretty

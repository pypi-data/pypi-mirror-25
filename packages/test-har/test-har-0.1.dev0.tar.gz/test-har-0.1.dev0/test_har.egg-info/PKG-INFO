        ----
        Why?
        ----
        
        Writing tests for API backends can often involve a lot of repetitive code in
        the tests to construct the content either to POST to the API or the expected
        content in the response against which to make assertions.  For example,
        constructing a Python dictionary to represent the JSON POSTed to or returned
        from the API.  Similarly, testing the returned content often requires many
        detailed assertions in order to sufficiently cover how the API should behave.
        
        While writing this repetitive test code is tedious, more importantly, it isn't
        very readable and makes discerning the intended behavior the test is meant to
        cover unnecessarily difficult.  Ideally, one should be able to describe the
        expected behavior of the API in a format much closer to the format used by the
        API.  Also ideally, one should be able to clearly read related requests and
        responses together.
        
        The JSON-based `HTTP Archive`_ (HAR) format used by browsers for recording
        browser sessions gives us exactly such a format, especially for JSON-based
        APIs.  The `test_har` package provides support for using HAR files to drive
        tests and make the more common assertions against the response while still
        allowing the developer to continue doing anything not able to be covered using
        the HAR file the same way they would have otherwise.

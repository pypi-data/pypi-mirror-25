Description: 
        pyDHE
        ============
        
        pyDHE is a simple to use Diffie-Hellman implementation written in python, for
        python. It makes using Diffie-Hellman a breeze so you can focus on the real
        crypto.
        
        This library was created out of need, because none of the standard crypto
        libraries provide DHE, and of the separate libraries out there, they were
        all complicated, incomplete, or requireed manual installation from github.
        This library is to change that. The goal is too provide a simple API that is
        similar to the pyCrypto and pyCryptodome libraries. The goal is familiarity
        and seamless blending with existing code.

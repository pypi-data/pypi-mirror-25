AudioTSM is a python library for real-time audio time-scale modification
procedures, i.e. algorithms that change the speed of an audio signal without
changing its pitch.

Documentation:
   https://audiotsm.readthedocs.io/

Source code repository and issue tracker:
   https://github.com/Muges/audiotsm/

License:
   MIT -- see the file ``LICENSE`` for details.

Installation
------------

Audiotsm should work with python 2.7 and python 3.4+.

For now you should probably install audiotsm directly from the github
repository using pip::

    pip install git+https://github.com/Muges/audiotsm.git

A package should be available on PyPI soon.


You may also need to install the sounddevice_ library in order to run the
examples or to use a ``StreamWriter``.

Basic usage
-----------

The audiotsm package implements several time-scale modification procedures:

- OLA (Overlap-Add), which should only be used for percussive audio signals;
- WSOLA (Waveform Similarity-based Overlap-Add), an amelioration of the OLA
  procedure which should give good results on most inputs.

Below is a basic example showing how to reduce the speed of a wav file by half
using the WSOLA procedure::

    from audiotsm import wsola
    from audiotsm.io.wav import WavReader, WavWriter

    with WavReader(input_filename) as reader:
        with WavWriter(output_filename, reader.channels, reader.samplerate) as writer:
            tsm = wsola(reader.channels, speed=0.5)
            tsm.run(reader, writer)

"""
This file contains the full ImageFeaturizer class, which allows users to upload
an image directory, a csv containing a list of image URLs, or a directory with a
csv containing names of images in the directory.

It featurizes the images using pretrained, decapitated InceptionV3 model, and
saves the featurized data to a csv, as well as within the ImageFeaturizer class
itself. This allows data scientists to easily analyze image data using simpler models.

Functionality:

    1. Build the featurizer model. The class initializer ImageFeaturizer() takes as input:
        depth : int
            1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on how far down you want to sample the featurizer layer

        auto_sample : bool
            a boolean flag signalling automatic downsampling

        downsample_size : int
            desired number of features to downsample the final layer to. Must be an
            integer divisor of the number of features in the layer.

    2. Load the data. The self.load_data() function takes as input:
            image_column_headers : str
                the name of the column holding the image data, if a csv exists,
                or what the name of the column will be, if generating the csv
                from a directory

            image_path : str
                the path to the folder containing the images. If using URLs, leave blank

            csv_path : str
                the path to the csv. If just using a directory, leave blank, and
                specify the path for the generated csv in new_csv_name.
                If csv exists, this is the path where the featurized csv will be
                generated.

            new_csv_name : str
                the path to the new csv, if one is being generated from a directory.
                If no csv exists, this is the path where the featurized csv will
                be generated

            scaled_size : tuple
                The size that the images get scaled to. Default is (299, 299)

            grayscale : bool
                Decides if image is grayscale or not. May get deprecated. Don't
                think it works on the InceptionV3 model due to input size.

    3. Featurize the data. The self.featurize() function takes no input, and featurizes
       the loaded data, writing the new csvs to the same path as the loaded csv
       Also adds a binary "image_missing" column automatically, for any images that are missing
       from the image list.

    3a. Users can also load and featurize the data in one pass, with the
        self.load_and_featurize_data function, which takes the same input as the
        load_data function and performs the featurization automatically.

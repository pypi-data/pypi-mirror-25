`Pythonista <http://omz-software.com/pythonista/>`_ on steroids.

    Pythonista is a complete development environment for writing Pythonâ„¢
    scripts on your iPad or iPhone.

Pythonista is a great tool. But it lacks some features like keyboard shortcuts
for specific actions. I'm slow without them. So I decided to write set of
scripts to *fix* all these issues. To speed up my iteration cycle. To make
it as fast as possible. And which snake is the speediest one on the planet?
`Black Mamba <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_mamba>`_. And you know
why it's called Black Mamba now :)

Status
======

It's still an experiment and you can expect breaking changes. I'm trying
to avoid them, but I can't promise stable interface for now.

You're welcome to report `new issue <https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/issues/new>`_
if you find a bug or would like to have something added. Or `pull request
<https://github.com/zrzka/blackmamba/pulls>`_ which is even better.


Package Installation
====================

.. code-block:: python

    import requests as r; exec(r.get('http://bit.ly/get-blackmamba').text)

Copy the above line, paste into Pythonista interactive prompt and execute it.
Black Mamba will be installed under the ``site-packages-3`` folder.


Updates
-------

Black Mamba checks for updates automatically (once a day). This can be modified
via ``check_for_updates`` and ``check_interval`` variables in the ``updates``
module. Anyway, if you see a message about new version available, just repeat
package installation steps to install new version until real update will be
implemented.


pythonista_startup.py
=====================

Copy & paste ...

.. code-block:: python

    #!python3
    import blackmamba as bm
    bm.main()

... into ``~/Documents/site-packages-3/pythonista_startup.py`` and you're
ready to use following shortcuts:

==================  ========================================
Shortcut            Function
==================  ========================================
``Cmd /``           Comment / uncomment selected line(s)
``Cmd W``           Close current editor tab
``Cmd Shift W``     Close all editor tabs except current one
``Cmd N``           New tab + new file
``Cmd T``           Just new tab
``Cmd 0``           Show / hide navigator (Library)
``Cmd Shift 0``     Query selected text in Dash
``Cmd Shift O``     Open Quickly...
``Cmd Shift R``     Run Quickly...
``Cmd Shift A``     Action Quickly...
``Cmd Shift L``     Outline Quickly...
``Ctrl Shift B``    Analyze & Check Style
``Cmd Shift K``     Clear annotations
``Cmd U``           Run Unit Tests... (experimental)
``Ctrl Tab``        Show Next Tab (or ``Cmd Shift ]``)
``Ctrl Shift Tab``  Show Previous Tab (or ``Cmd Shift [``)
``Cmd 1..9``        Show nth tab
``Ctrl L``          Jump to line
``Cmd E``           Drag Provider
==================  ========================================

**WARNING**: *Run Quickly...* and *Action Quickly...* works only and only
if there's no running script. If there's running script, you'll see
your script in the editor (new tab), but the script wasn't executed.

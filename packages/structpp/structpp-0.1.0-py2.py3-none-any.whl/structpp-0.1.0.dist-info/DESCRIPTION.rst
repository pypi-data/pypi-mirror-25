Struct++
---------

Struct++ (also called structpp) provides a wrapper around the struct module in the python
standard library will additional support for packed bitfields and decoding structs into
a named tuple by annotated field names.

It is a 100%% drop in replacement for struct and its format string syntax is a superset of
the syntax used inside the struct module.

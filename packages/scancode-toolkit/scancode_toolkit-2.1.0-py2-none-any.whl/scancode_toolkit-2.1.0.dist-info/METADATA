ScanCode is a suite of utilities used to scan a codebase for license,
copyright, packages dependencies and other interesting information that
can be discovered in source and binary code files.

A typical software project often reuses hundreds of third-party
components. License and origin information is often scattered and not
easy to find: ScanCode discovers this data for you.

ScanCode provides accurate scan results and the line position
where each result is found. The results can be formatted as JSON or
HTML. ScanCode provides a simple HTML app for quick visualization of
scan results (see screenshot below), but you will have more robust analysis
options if you use AboutCode Manager to view a scan. AboutCode Manager is 
a desktop application available or Linux, OSX or Windows - go to 
https://github.com/nexB/aboutcode-manager to learn more or to download 
AboutCode Manager.

We are continuously working on new features, such as analysis of
dependencies or improving  performance for scanning of larger codebases.

See the roadmap for upcoming features:
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Roadmap

Quick Start
===========

For Windows, please go to the 
`Comprehensive Installation <https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation>`_ 
section instead.

Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed:
 * Download and install Python 2.7 32 bits for Windows 
   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13.msi
 * Download and install Python 2.7 for Mac 
   https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/python-2.7.13-macosx10.6.pkg

On Linux install Python 2.7 "devel" and a few extra packages:

 * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev bzip2 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``
   for Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04 and 16.04

 * ``sudo apt-get install python-dev libbz2-1.0 xz-utils zlib1g libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev``
   for Debian and Debian-based distros

 * ``sudo yum install python-devel zlib bzip2-libs xz-libs libxml2-devel libxslt-devel``
   for RPM distros

 * ``sudo dnf install python-devel zlib bzip2-libs xz-libs libxml2-devel libxslt-devel``
   for Fedora 22 and later

 * See the Comprehensive Installation for additional details and other
   Linux installations: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki/Comprehensive-Installation

Next, download and extract the latest ScanCode release from::

    https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/releases/

Open a terminal, extract the downloaded release archive, then `cd` to
the extracted directory and run this command to display the command
help. ScanCode will self-configure if needed::

    ./scancode --help

Run a sample scan saved to the `samples.html` file::

    ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html

Then open `samples.html` in your web browser to view the scan results. 

See more command examples::

    ./scancode --examples


Support
=======

If you have a problem, a suggestion or found a bug, please enter a ticket at:
https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues

For other questions, discussions, and chats, we have:

- a mailing list at https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/aboutcode-discuss

- an official Gitter channel at https://gitter.im/aboutcode-org/discuss
  Gitter also has an IRC bridge at https://irc.gitter.im/

- an official #aboutcode IRC channel on freenode (server chat.freenode.net)
  for scancode and other related tools. Note that this receives
  notifactions from repos so it can be a tad noisy. You can use your
  favorite IRC client or use the web chat at
  https://webchat.freenode.net/


About archives
==============

All code must be extracted before running ScanCode since ScanCode will
not extract files from tarballs, zip files, etc. However, the ScanCode
Toolkit comes with a utility called extractcode that does recursive
archive extraction. For example, this command will recursively extract
the mytar.tar.bz2 tarball in the mytar.tar.bz2-extract directory::

    ./extractcode mytar.tar.bz2


Source code
===========

* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit.git
* https://github.com/nexB/scancode-thirdparty-src.git


License
=======

* Apache-2.0 with an acknowledgement required to accompany the scan output.
* Public domain CC-0 for reference datasets.
* Multiple licenses (GPL2/3, LGPL, MIT, BSD, etc.) for third-party components. 

See the NOTICE file for more details.


Documentation & FAQ
===================

https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/wiki


Basic Usage
===========

Run this command for a list of options (On Windows use `scancode`
instead of `./scancode`)::

    ./scancode --help

Run this command for a list of command line examples::

    ./scancode --examples

To run a scan on sample data, first run this::

    ./scancode --format html-app samples samples.html

Then open samples.html in your web browser to see the results.

   with the latest SPDX license list

 * Multiple bug fixes such as:

   * Ensure that authors are reported even if there is no copyright #669
   * Fix Maven package POM parsing infinite loop #721
   * Improve handling of weird non-unicode byte paths #688 and #706

2.0.1 (2017-07-03)
------------------

 This is a minor release with minor new and improved features and bug
 fixes.

 * New and improved license detection, including refined match scoring
   for #534
 * Bug fixed in License detection leading to a very long scan time for some
   rare JavaScript files. Reported by @jarnugirdhar
 * New "base_name" attribute returned with file information. Reported by
   @chinyeungli
 * Bug fixed in Maven POM package detection. Reported by @kalagp


2.0.0 (2017-06-23)
------------------

 This is a major release with several new and improved features and bug
 fixes.

 Some of the key highlights include:

 * License:

   * Brand new, faster and accurate detection engine using multiple
     techniques eventually doing multiple exhaustive comparisons of
     a scanned file content against all the license and rule texts.

   * Several new licenses and over 2500+ new and improved licenses
     detection rules have been added making the detection significantly
     better (and weirdly enough faster too as a side-effect of the new
     detection engine)

   * the matched license text can be optionally returned with the
     `--license-text` option

   * The detection accuracy has been benchmarked against other detection
     engine and ScanCode has shown to be more accurate and
     comprehensive than all the other engines reviewed.

   * improved scoring of license matches


 * Package and dependencies:

  * new and improved detection of multiple package formats: NPM, Maven,
    NuGet, PHP Composer, Python Pypi and RPM. In most cases direct,
    declared dependencies are also reported.

  * several additional package formats will be reported in the future
    version.

  * note: the structure of Packages data is evolving and should not be
    considered API at this stage


 * Scan outputs: 

  * New SPDX tag/values and RDF outputs.

  * new compact JSON format (the pretty printed format is still
    available with the the `json-pp` format).
    The JSON format has been changed significantly and is closer to a
    documented, standard format that we call the ABC data format.

  * Minor refinements on the html and html-app format. Note that the
    html-app format will be deprecated and replaced by the new AboutCode
    Manager desktop app (electron-based) in future versions.


 * Copyright: Improved copyright detection: several false positive are
   no longer returned and copyright s are more accurate


 * Archive: support for shallow extraction and support for new archive
   types (such as Spring boot shell archives)


 * Performance:

  * Everything is generally faster, and license detection performance
    has been significantly improved.

  * Scans can run on multiple processes in parallel with the new 
    `--processes` option speeding up things even further. A scan of a
    full Debian pool of source packages was reported to scan in about
    11 hours (on a rather beefy 144 cores, 256GB machine)

  * Reduced memory usage with the use of caching

 * Other notes:

   * This is the last release with Linux 32 bits architecture support
   * The scan of a file can be interrupted after a timeout with a 120
     seconds default
   * ScanCode is now available as a library on the Pypi Python package
     index for use as a library. The documentation for the library usage
     will follow in future versions
   * New `--ignore` option: You can optionally ignore certain file and
     paths during a scan
   * New `--diag option`: display additional debug and diagnostic data
   * The scanned file paths can now reported as relative, rooted or
     absolute with new command line options with a default to a rooted
     path.

Synology PhotoStation Python API
================================

A Python API to communicate with `Photo Station <https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/6.1/packages/PhotoStation>`_ running on Synology NAS. Photos and videos are uploaded directly to PhotoStation through its Web API with various metadata including ratings, title, description, and GPS coordinates.

This module uploads original files and lets Synology to process the required thumbnail versions. This works fine with Synology DS916+ but might be too slow with models having slower processors.

Supported features:

* Login to your shared or personal Photo Station
* List album contents
* Create missing albums automatically
* Add new photos
* Update metadata of existing photos
* Update photo binaries based if either timestamp or filesize differs
* Delete photos

Tested with Synology DS916+ running DSM 6.1 and Photo Station 6.7.1. Should work with older versions too but you mileage may vary.

###############################
Welcome to FDB's documentation!
###############################

FDB is a `Python <http://python.org>`__ library package that
implements `Python Database API 2.0`-compliant support for the open source relational database `FirebirdÂ® <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__.
In addition to the minimal feature set of the standard Python DB API, FDB also exposes nearly the entire native client API of the database engine and number of additional extensions and enhancements for convenient use of Firebird.

FDB is a `sub-project <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/devel-python-driver/>`__ under the `Firebird Project <http://www.firebirdsql.org>`__, and is used internally as key component for `Firebird QA <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/devel-qa/>`__.

FDB is free -- covered by a permissive BSD-style `license <license.html>`__ that both commercial and noncommercial users should find agreeable.

This documentation set is not a tutorial on Python, SQL, or Firebird; rather, it is a topical presentation of FDB's feature set, with example code to demonstrate basic usage patterns. For detailed information about Firebird features, see the `Firebird documentation <http://www.firebirdsql.org/en/documentation/>`__, and especially the excellent `The Firebird Book <http://www.ibphoenix.com/products/books/firebird_book>`__ written by Helen Borrie and published by IBPhoenix.

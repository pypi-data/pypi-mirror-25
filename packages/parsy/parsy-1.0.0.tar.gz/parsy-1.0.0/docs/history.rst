.. currentmodule:: parsy

1.0.0 - unreleased
------------------

* Improved parse failure messages of ``@generate`` parsers. Previously
  the parser was given a default description of the function name,
  which hides all useful internal info there might be.
* Added :meth:`Parser.sep_by`
* Added :func:`test_char`
* Added :func:`char_from`
* Added :func:`string_from`
* Added :data:`any_char`
* Added :data:`decimal_digit`
* Added :meth:`Parser.concat`
* Fixed parsy so that it can again work with tokens as well as strings, allowing it to
  be used as both a :doc:`lexer or parser or both <howto/lexing>`, with docs and tests.
* Added :func:`test_item`
* Added :func:`match_item`
* Added :meth:`Parser.should_fail`

Version 1.0.4:
    bug fixes:
        - while using gene-tree distributions, output and input folders where mixed and readings were being made incorrectly. Now fixed.
Version 1.0.3:
    bug fixes:
        - runART option was not retrieved from the settings, so automatically it was not running ART. now fixed.
        - runs correctly now for input mode 4.
        - coverage matrix floating points now 3 (before 4)
        - when handling ancestral sequence file, the access to the sequence was wrong.
        - some variable names were misspelled.
Version 1.0.2
    bug fixes:
        - checking existence of INDELible control file: path generated was badly formatted.
        - checking branch lengths of the trees now works fine.
        - the streams to check the dependencies of the third-party software now work fine.
        - for the sequence generation, I was using a wrong variable name for settings, now works fine
        - dendropy depency was missing in some files
        - removed the extra folder generated in alignments
        - error writing VCF files, all files were written in the no_error folder. fixed.
Version 1.0.1
    pypi registration
Version 1.0.0
    structured as packaged and github push
Version 0.2.2
    log file only available when using debug log level. running time files
    outputted only as asked.
Version 0.2.1
    added new input mode.
Version 0.2.0
    getting ready version. Renamed output folders.
Version 0.1.9
    In-line documentation
Version 0.1.8
    package organization
Version 0.1.7
    Added coverage distributions
Version 0.1.6
    Threading added for read-counts
Version 0.1.5
    Threading added for ART
Version 0.1.4
	Changed name repository to ngsphy
Version 0.1.3
    Fully functioning. Allows the simulation of diploid individuals and posterior
	NGS reads from a SimPhy Project folder. Also, log output (standard output) has some color on
	for the different log call types.
Version 0.1.2
	Changed name repository to simphy-ngs-wrapper
Version 0.1.1
	Changed functionality of the script. It now takes a single prefix and a project
	folder, iterates over all the species trees, takes the fasta files with the
	selected prefix and mates those files outputting them into a folder
	inside the project folder called INDIVIDUALS
Version 0.1.0
	Generated "individuals" go now into a "individuals" folder, organized by
	Species tree ID and Gene Tree ID, all files in a single folder is at all
	manageable.
	Reformatted the names of the generated files.
	Mating file "db", now has an extra field. This field identifies the individual.
	Single output folder for all the sequences.
	All individuals have a specific name which allows not to get confused.
Version 0.0.9
	Getting information about the species tree that have even/odd number
	of individuals per species
Version 0.0.8
	It is possible to write different number of output according to
	preferences.
Version 0.0.7
	Run is no longer finished if a replicate has no sequences
	it will just skip it.
Version 0.0.6
	Enhanced logger
Version 0.0.5
	Added logging handler
Version 0.0.4
	Multiple prefixes for simphy datasets
	Automatically defining the format of the numbers
Version 0.0.3
	Mating running, missing tests on larger group.
	Formatter for bash added
	outgroups are used with a single sequence
Version 0.0.2
	Still issues with the outgroups.
	Mating done
	Added error coloring
	I'm going to have problems when replicates are above 9999
Version 0.0.1
	How to simulate 2 outgroups - is it better with outgroups or without outgroups.
	SO - What's the meaning of this parameter in terms of outgroups
	I'll omit the outgroups for this version

==============  ======

An implementation of models, views etc. that can act as **pages**, though they
have no content fields to speak of. Bring Your Own Content.

Pages consist only of a URL and a way to render a template at that URL. The
default model implementation uses `django-templateselector`_ to provide template
selection from HTML files within ``<templatedir>/varlet/pages/layouts``

The application uses `swapper`_ to theoretically allow for using a different
model.

If the application is mounted at the project root ``/``, Pages may not have
URLs which collide with those of another application in the urlconf.

The license
-----------

It's the `FreeBSD`_. There's should be a ``LICENSE`` file in the root of the repository, and in any archives.

Change history for django-varlet
-------------------------------------------------------------

0.2.3
^^^^^^
* Autocomplete outside of the tests & demo project (ie: any actual usage)
  wasn't working, and worse, was causing a ``TemplateDoesNotExist`` exception
  for the change form. See ``6b8487db38a5c0abab7af324cf05b2144f4dea67``

0.2.2
^^^^^^
* Fixed tests which broke via continuous integration, but didn't with my local
  requirements, because I'd introduced further validation in ``django-templateselector``
  See ``9834ef35189805152f1a61f6b7d02d5f4a20c06e`` for the changes.

0.2.1
^^^^^^
* Added typeahead/autocomplete to the URL field for a page.

0.2.0
^^^^^^
* Initial release

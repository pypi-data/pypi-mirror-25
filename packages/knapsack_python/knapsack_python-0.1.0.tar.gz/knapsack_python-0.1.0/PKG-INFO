        knapsack\_python: Solves a variety of knapsack problems
        =======================================================
        
        This package is a collection of solutions to various knapsack problems.
        In particular, it has solutions to:
        
        -  the 01 knapsack problem,
        -  the 01 multi-knapsack problem (MKP),
        
        and potentially more in the future. A good introduction to these sorts
        of problems can be found on Wikipedia
        (`here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem>`__ and
        `here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_knapsack_problems>`__).
        Additionally, it contains functions I've found useful in my work. One
        such function is ``assign_all``, which assigns all items to one or more
        knapsacks while trying to adhere as best as possible to the capacities
        of each knapsack. Most of the solutions are a direct translation of the
        solutions given in Silvano Martello and Paolo Toth excellent book
        `*Knapsack Problems: Algorithms and Computer
        Implementations* <http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/1035174>`__.
        
        The implementations of these solutions are all written in C++ and
        wrapped in Cython for use in Python.

aDDM Toolbox
============

This toolbox can be used to perform model fitting and to generate
simulations for the attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM), as well as
for the classic version of the drift-diffusion model (DDM) without an
attentional component.

Prerequisites
-------------

This toolbox requires the following libraries: \* deap \* matplotlib \*
numpy \* pandas \* scipy

Installing
----------

::

    $ pip install addm_toolbox

Running tests
-------------

To make sure everything is working correctly after installation, try:

::

    $ addm_run_tests

This should take a while to finish, so maybe go get a cup of tea :)

Getting started
---------------

To get a feel for how the algorithm works, try:

::

    $ addm_demo --display-figures

You can see all the arguments available for the demo using:

::

    $ addm_demo --help

You can also have a look at the code in the following modules: \*
addm.py contains the aDDM implementation, with functions to generate
model simulations and obtain the likelihood for a given data trial. \*
ddm.py is equivalent to addm.py but for the DDM. \* addm\_pta\_test.py
generates an artificial data set for a given set of aDDM parameters and
attempts to recover these parameters through maximum a posteriori
estimation. \* ddm\_pta\_test.py is equivalent to addm\_pta\_test.py but
for the DDM. \* addm\_pta\_mle.py fits the aDDM to a data set by
performing maximum likelihood estimation. \* addm\_pta\_map.py performs
model comparison for the aDDM by obtaining a posterior distribution over
a set of models. \* simulate\_addm\_true\_distributions.py generates
aDDM simulations using empirical data for the fixations.

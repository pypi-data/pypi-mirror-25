# Cleaning up code
### Website generation
- Maybe run rankings for previous week if not already saved somewhere ... ? Might be tricky if it rewrites over something you didn't want it to.

### Command line arguments
- Attribute code for settings/private league

# Further Things to Develop
### Playoffs
- Figure out how to handle playoff weeks automatically
- If week input is too large, maybe stop at last game of regular season for now

### Summary plot of rankings vs week
- read the txt files
- do both for power rankings and espn rankings
- maybe add to team page?

### Testing
- Implement some unit tests

### Error Handling
- Something breaks with number of teams changing (see Physics League...)
- Have more than zero error handling

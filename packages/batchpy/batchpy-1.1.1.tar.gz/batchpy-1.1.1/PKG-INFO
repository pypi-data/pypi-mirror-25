Description: batchpy
        =======
        
        A python package to run large or small batches of similar calculations and storing the results so no double calculations are performed.
        Batches of computation with lots of result data can be performed as results are stored on disk and only loaded in memory when required.
        Furthermore, methods for easily retrieving runs with certain parameters are available to ease post-processing and visualizing data.

        Examples:

        .. code:: python
        
            subgrab                             # To run in current working directory.
        
            subgrab -m Doctor Strange           # For custom movie subtitle download.
        
            subgrab -m Doctor Strange -s        # Silent mode (No prompts i.e., title selection [if not found]).
        
            subgrab -d "DIRECTORY_PATH"         # For specific directory.
        
            subgrab -m The Intern 2015 -s -l AR # Language specified (First two characters of the language).
        
            subgrab -m The Intern 2015 -c 3 -s  # Download 3 subtitles for the movie.
        
        Features:
        =========
        
        -  Two Mode (CLI and Silent inside individual media downloading [-m]) -
           CLI mode is executed when the title (provided i.e. media name) is not
           recognized by the site. Mostly when year is not provied (when two or
           more media names collide). Silent mode is usually executed when year
           is provided in the argument. Optional, you can also specify silent
           mode argument - which forces to download subtitles without title
           selection prompt. The media argument (-m) followed by the silent mode
           (-s) argument forces silent mode.
        
        -  Subtitles count argument added which allows you to download multiple
           subtitles for an individual media. This is useful when the exact
           match is not found and you can download multiple srt files and check
           them if they are in sync with the media file (integrated in v0.12).
        
        -  Added multiple languages support (v0.12).
        
        -  Allows you to download subtitles for movies by specifying movie name
           and year (optional).
        
        -  Allows you to download subtitles for media files in a specified
           directory.
        
        -  Cross-platform (Tested on Linux and Windows).
        
        -  Logs generation on script execution (v0.15).
        
        -  Supports SubDB now.

FMI-compliant Model Estimation in Python
========================================

   :alt: modestpy

Description
-----------

**modestpy** facilitates parameter estimation in models compliant with
`Functional Mock-up Interface <https://fmi-standard.org/>`__. The
estimation can be performed on a single or multiple random learning
periods (to avoid overfitting). Currently the estimation is based on
`genetic algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm>`__
(GA) and `pattern
search <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_search_(optimization)>`__
(PS) methods. The user is free to choose whether to use GA, PS or
combined GA+PS. Both methods can deal with non-continuous and
non-differentiable models.

The package is compatible with Python 2.7 due to its reliance on
`PyFMI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFMI>`__.

Installation
------------

The package can be installed from PyPI:

::

    pip install modestpy

On Ubuntu 16.04 or newer, if you get a permission error, you might have to install in the user local directory:

::

    pip install --user modestpy

To get the latest development version download directly from GitHub repository:

::

    git clone https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py modestpy
    cd modestpy
    pip install .

**modestpy** relies on `PyFMI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyFMI>`__
for FMU simulation, which is advised to be installed as part of
`JModelica <http://jmodelica.org/>`__ (current version 2.0). Other
dependencies are included in `requirements.txt </requirements.txt>`__.

To run tests:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy.test import run
    >>> run.tests()

Usage
-----

Users are supposed to call only the high level API included in
``modestpy.Estimation``. The API is fully discussed in `this
wiki <https://github.com/sdu-cfei/modest-py/wiki/modestpy-API>`__. You
can also check out this `simple example </examples/simple>`__. The basic
usage is as follows:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy import Estimation
    >>> session = Estimation(workdir, fmu_path, inp, known, est, ideal)
    >>> estimates = session.estimate()
    >>> err, res = session.validate()

To get more control, use the optional arguments:

.. code:: python

    >>> from modestpy import Estimation
    >>> session = Estimation(workdir, fmu_path, inp, known, est, ideal,
                             lp_n=3, lp_len=3600, lp_frame=(0, 86400), vp=(86400, 172800),
                             ic_param={'Tstart': 'T'}, ga_iter=30, ps_iter=30)
    >>> estimates = session.estimate()
    >>> err, res = session.validate(use_type='avg')  # Validation using average estimates from all learning periods
    >>> err, res = session.validate(use_type='best') # Validation using best estimates from all learning periods

``modestpy.Estimation`` automatically saves results in the working
directory including csv files with estimates and some useful plots,
e.g.:

1) Error evolution in combined GA+PS estimation (dots represent switch
   from GA to PS): |Error-evolution|

2) Visualization of GA evolution: |GA-evolution|

3) Scatter matrix plot for interdependencies between parameters:
   |Intedependencies|

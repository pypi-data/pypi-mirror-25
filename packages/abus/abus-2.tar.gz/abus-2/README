ABuS is a script for backing up (and restoring) your files to a local disk.

The backups are encrypted, compressed, and deduplicated.

It is assumed that another program (e.g. rsync) is used to make off-site
copies of the backups.


Missing Features
================

- Documentation
- Deletion of old backups
- Reconstruction of index database from backup meta data
- "Flattening" of restores
- Restore target directory other than "."


Installation
============

1. Install Python 3.6 from python.org

   - include pip
   - it helps to add python to path

2. From command line, "as administrator" if python has been installed "for all users":

   ``c:\path\to\python36\scripts\pip install abus-0.tar.gz``

3. Create minimal config file, e.g.::

    logfile c:/my/home/abus.log
    archive e:/backups
    password password1234 just kidding!
    [include]
    c:/my/home

4. Create the archive dir referenced in the config file and create and empty index database with

   ``c:\path\to\python36\scripts\abus.exe -f c:/my/home/abus.cfg --init``

5. Add to Task Scheduler:

   ``c:\path\to\python36\scripts\abus.exe -f c:/my/home/abus.cfg --backup``

   If there are any problems that prevent abus from getting as far as opening
   the log file (and Windows permissions can cause many such problems), then
   use cmd.exe to allow redirection:

   ``cmd /c c:\path\to\python36\scripts\abus.exe -f c:/my/home/abus.cfg --backup >c:\abus.err 2>&1``

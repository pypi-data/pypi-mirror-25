This is ABuS version 1 (alpha)


Known Problems

   - Reconstruction of index database from backup meta data
   - "Flattening" of restores
   - Restore target directory other than "."


Installation
============

1. Install Python 3.6 from python.org
    - include pip
    - it helps to add python to path
2. From command line:
       - "as administrator" if python has been installed "for all users"
     c:\path\to\python36\scripts\pip install abus-0.tar.gz
3. Create minimal config file, e.g.:
    logfile c:/my/home/abus.log
    archive e:/backups
    password password1234 just kidding!
    [include]
    c:/my/home
    [exclude]
    *#
    *.lck
    *.lock
    */~*
    */desktop.ini
    */UsrClass.dat*
    */ZbThumbnail.info
    *cache/*
4. Add to Task Scheduler:
     c:\path\to\python36\scripts\abus.exe -f c:/my/home/abus.cfg --backup
     run as yourself or LocalSystem as required
   If there are any problems that prevent abus from getting as far as opening
   the log file (and Windows permissions can cause many such problems), then
   use cmd.exe to allow redirection:
     cmd /c c:\path\to\python36\scripts\abus.exe -f c:/my/home/abus.cfg --backup >c:\abus.err 2>&1

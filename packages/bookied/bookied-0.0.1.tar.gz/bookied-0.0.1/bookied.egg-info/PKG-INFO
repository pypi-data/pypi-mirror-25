Description: # Witness Lookup
        
        This project collects all data relevant for witnesses to properly
        cooperate on the PeerPlays network when it comes to the games in th e
        *Bookie* app.
        
        All data is stored in YAML-formated `*.yaml` files and are organized in
        a folder hierarchy.
        
        # Structure
        
        Basic settings are stored in `index.yaml` in the root directory. From
        there, we enter [`sports/`](sports/) to go into the data for each sport,
        respectively.

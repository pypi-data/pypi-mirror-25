=======
pkgcore
=======

pkgcore is a framework for package management; via the appropriate class
plugins, the design should allow for any underlying repository/config/format to
be used; slackware's tgzs being exempted due to lack of any real metadata, and
autopackage format being exempted due to the fact they effectively embed the
manager in each package (pkgcore *does* require being able to treat the pkg as
data, instead of autopackage's method of handing resolution/all manager ops off
to the package script).

Tools
=====

**pclean**: clean distfiles, binpkgs, and builds dirs

**pclonecache**: clone a repository cache

**pconfig**: query configuration info

**pebuild**: low-level ebuild operations, go through phases manually

**pinspect**: inspect repository related info

**pmaint**: repository maintenance (syncing, copying...)

**pmerge**: dependency resolution, fetching, (un)merging, etc.

**pquery**: query repository info, revdeps, pkg search, vdb search, etc.

Requirements
============

At least python version 2.7, and snakeoil_ â€” a utility library with misc
optimizations split out of pkgcore for others to use.

Installing
==========

Installing latest pypi release in a virtualenv::

    pip install pkgcore

Installing from git in a virtualenv (note that snakeoil should be used from git)::

    pip install https://github.com/pkgcore/snakeoil/archive/master.tar.gz
    pip install https://github.com/pkgcore/pkgcore/archive/master.tar.gz

Installing from a tarball or git repo::

    python setup.py install
    pplugincache

Documentation
=============

Official documentation is provided on readthedocs_ with alternative
formats available for download_.

Tests
=====

A standalone test runner is integrated in setup.py; to run, just execute::

    python setup.py test

In addition, a tox config is provided so the testsuite can be run in a
virtualenv setup against all supported python versions. To run tests for all
environments just execute **tox** in the root directory of a repo or unpacked
tarball. Otherwise, for a specific python version execute something similar to
the following::

    tox -e py27

Note that mock_ is required for tests when using python-2.7.

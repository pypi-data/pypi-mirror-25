M2Core is a framework build over Tornado web server. It helps you to build an effective REST API in a few minutes.
We use a mix of Tornado, SQLAlchemy and Redis. M2Core has lots of helpers to do you ordinary tasks while building handlers
for your REST API. Real benefits are achieved when you are making


### The list of main features:

* **handy BaseModel mixin**

* **a bunch of decorators for permissions check, try-catch block and etc.**

* **automatic documentation in JSON per each method of each handler retrieved from docstrings**

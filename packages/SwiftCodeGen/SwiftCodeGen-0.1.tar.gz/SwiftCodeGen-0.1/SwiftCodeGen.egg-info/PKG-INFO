        ************
        
        A command line utility to generate model and web service classes in Swift programming language. This is a simple and lightweight tool for developers to automate a part of effort. The tool will generate all the required model classes and web service classes based on `Alamofire <https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire>`_ and `ObjectMapper <https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper>`_ with a single command.

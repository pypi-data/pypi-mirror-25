SwiftCodeGen
************

A command line utility to generate model and web service classes in Swift programming language. This is a simple and lightweight tool for developers to automate a part of effort. The tool will generate all the required model classes and web service classes based on `Alamofire <https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire>`_ and `ObjectMapper <https://github.com/Hearst-DD/ObjectMapper>`_ with a single command.

============
Installation
============
SwiftCodeGen is written in Python, and it requires python 2.7 or above to work.

Install SwiftGen and use simple commands.

.. code-block:: guess

   $ pip install SwiftCodeGen

If you have already a version installed...

.. code-block:: guess

   $ pip install SwiftCodeGen --update

=====
Usage
=====
SwiftCodeGen uses `SwiftGenConf.json` file to keep api details and other common properties to configure basic setups. It also uses template files to generate model and service classes. More documentation can be found `here <https://github.com/akhilraj-rajkumar/swift-code-gen#swiftcodegen>`_

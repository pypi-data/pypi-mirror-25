        ============================
        
        A wrapper for Certbot CLI https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#manual
        
        Executes certbot on your OS with the given parameters and performs the
        requests to Route53 to create the TXT record and validate back to Cerbot.
        
        If validation is succeeded, Cerbot will issue the certificates and upload
        them in Amazon Certificate Manager. If the certificate for the given domain
        already exists, it will replace the certificates instead of creating a new
        ARN (this is usually what you want).
        
        For obvious reasons, certbot needs access to public DNS zones. At Payconiq,
        our DNS is held by Production account but one might need certificates on
        Acceptance as well. In this case, the library accepts a profile to
        indicate in which account your DNS records are. How to choose a profile is
        documented directly on AWS.
